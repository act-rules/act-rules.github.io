The programmatically determined name of a user interface element that is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree).

The accessible name is calculated using the [accessible name and description computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname).

For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional information on how to calculate the accessible name can be found in [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0, Accessible Name and Description Computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/#accessible-name-and-description-computation) (work in progress) and [SVG Accessibility API Mappings, Name and Description](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/#mapping_additional) (work in progress).
