Generic placeholder text is text content that is ambiguous in its meaning and does therefore not provide any useful information in the context in which the text is used.

Typically, generic placeholder text is inserted by authoring tools to populate content attributes that have not been specified by content authors. The text will likely be specific to the authoring tool and system language settings. 

In the English language, examples of generic placeholder text used to populate the `alt` attribute of HTML `img` elements include, but is not limited to:

- "default"
- "image"
- "spacer"
