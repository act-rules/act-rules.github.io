Serving only an aesthetic purpose, providing no information, and having no functionality. 

**Note:** Authors can mark an `img` element as decorative to indicate that it should be ignored by assistive technology by using either `role="presentation"`, `role="none"`, or `alt=""`. An element should only be marked as decorative if removing the element does not cause a loss of information to the user.
