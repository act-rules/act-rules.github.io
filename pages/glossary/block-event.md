A _blocked event_ makes no [changes to the content][changes in content] of the [web page][] within a 1 minute time span of the [event firing][].

**Note:** The 1 minute time span is an arbitrary limit which is not mentioned in any WCAG success criteria. For accessibility testing purposes a time limit is required, otherwise testing consistently would be impractical.
