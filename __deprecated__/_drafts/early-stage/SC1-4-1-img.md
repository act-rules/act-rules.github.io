Check if images meet [[1.4.1 Use of Color]].

## Open issues
- Failure F13 relates to two SCs. How to handle that?

## Background
- [G14: Ensuring that information conveyed by color differences is also available in text](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140311/G14.html)
- [G111: Using color and pattern](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140311/G111.html)
- [F13: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 and 1.4.1 due to having a text alternative that does not include information that is conveyed by color differences in the image](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140311/F13.html)
- Comments from UWEM 2.0 draft:
- Not automatable.
- Cannot automatically determine if colour of images is used to convey information.
