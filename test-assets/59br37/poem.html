	<h1>The Raven</h1>
	<p>By Edgar Allan Poe</p>
	<p>
		Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br />
		Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br />
		While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br />
		As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br />
		“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br />
		Only this and nothing more.”
	</p>
	<p>
		Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br />
		And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br />
		Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br />
		From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br />
		For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br />
		Nameless here for evermore.
	</p>
	<p>
		And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br />
		Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br />
		So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br />
		“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—<br />
		Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—<br />
		This it is and nothing more.”
	</p>
	<p>
		Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br />
		“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br />
		But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br />
		And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br />
		That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—<br />
		Darkness there and nothing more.
	</p>
	<p>
		Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br />
		Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br />
		But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br />
		And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”<br />
		This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—<br />
		Merely this and nothing more.
	</p>
	<p>
		Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br />
		Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br />
		“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;<br />
		Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—<br />
		Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—<br />
		’Tis the wind and nothing more!”
	</p>
	<p>
		Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br />
		In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;<br />
		Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br />
		But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—<br />
		Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—<br />
		Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br />
		By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br />
		“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,<br />
		Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—<br />
		Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”<br />
		Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
	</p>
	<p>
		Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br />
		Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;<br />
		For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br />
		Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—<br />
		Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br />
		With such name as “Nevermore.”
	</p>
	<p>
		But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br />
		That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br />
		Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—<br />
		Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—<br />
		On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”<br />
		Then the bird said “Nevermore.”
	</p>
	<p>
		Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br />
		“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store<br />
		Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br />
		Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—<br />
		Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br />
		Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”
	</p>
	<p>
		But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,<br />
		Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;<br />
		Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br />
		Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—<br />
		What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br />
		Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”
	</p>
	<p>
		This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br />
		To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;<br />
		This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br />
		On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,<br />
		But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,<br />
		She shall press, ah, nevermore!
	</p>
	<p>
		Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br />
		Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br />
		“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee<br />
		Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;<br />
		Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”<br />
		Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
	</p>
	<p>
		“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—<br />
		Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br />
		Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—<br />
		On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—<br />
		Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”<br />
		Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
	</p>
	<p>
		“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!<br />
		By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—<br />
		Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br />
		It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br />
		Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”<br />
		Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
	</p>
	<p>
		“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—<br />
		“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!<br />
		Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br />
		Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!<br />
		Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”<br />
		Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
	</p>
	<p>
		And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br />
		On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br />
		And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,<br />
		And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br />
		And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br />
		Shall be lifted—nevermore!
