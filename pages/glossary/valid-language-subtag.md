A language tag consists of a [primary language subtag][] from the [language subtag registry][], optionally followed by a hyphen (`-`) and any sequence of characters.

_Note:_ This definition intentionally differs from the [BCP 47][] syntax as user agents and assistive technologies are more lenient in what they accept. The definition is however consistent with the behavior of the `:lang()` pseudo-selector as defined by [Selectors Level 3][]. For example, `de-hello` would be an accepted way to indicate German in current user agents and assistive technologies, despite not being valid according to [BCP 47][]. As a consequence of this definition, however, [grandfathered tags][] are not correctly recognized as valid language subtags.
