## Applicability

The rule applies to an [HTML document][] with an associated [Window object][] that has an [event listener list][] with one or more [event listeners][event listener] for [device orientation events][device orientation] or [device motion events][device motion].

## Expectation

For each registered [device orientation event][device orientation] or [device motion event][device motion] in the test target, an [instrument][] is available supporting the same outcomes of the event.

## Assumptions

- The motion to operate the device is not used through an [accessibility supported][] interface, which is listed as a valid exception to SC 2.5.4.
- The motion is not [essential][] for the functionality it triggers, which is listed as a valid exception to SC 2.5.4.

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

- [Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.4: Motion Actuation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/motion-actuation.html)
- [G213: Provide conventional controls and an application setting for motion activated input](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G213.html)
- [DeviceOrientation Event Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/orientation-event/)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This [HTML document][] that can be operated through the device's orientation to increase and decrease the value of a slider has the same functionality available through `button` elements.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Passed Example 1</title>
		<script src="/test-assets/7677a9/slider.js"></script>
		<script>
			function activateSlider() {
				document.getElementById('decreaseSlider').addEventListener('click', decreaseSlider)
				document.getElementById('increaseSlider').addEventListener('click', increaseSlider)
				window.addEventListener('deviceorientation', handleOrientation)
			}
		</script>
	</head>

	<body onload="activateSlider();">
		<pre class="output"></pre>

		<h1>Slider Motion Sensor Example</h1>

		<p>
			Open this slider on a device with a motion sensor, such as a smart phone or tablet. Tilt the device to the right
			and left to adjust the slider value. The decrease and increase buttons also adjust the value.
		</p>
		<p>Note: This example may not work across all browsers.</p>

		<div>
			<button id="decreaseSlider" type="button">Decrease Value</button>
			<input type="range" min="1" max="100" value="50" id="motionSlider" disabled />
			<button id="increaseSlider" type="button">Increase Value</button>
			<p aria-live="polite">Slider Value: <span id="output">50</span></p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

This [HTML document][] that can be operated by rotating the device to increase and decrease the value of a slider has the same functionality available through `button` elements.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Passed Example 2</title>
		<script src="/test-assets/7677a9/slider.js"></script>
		<script>
			function activateSlider() {
				document.getElementById('decreaseSlider').addEventListener('click', decreaseSlider)
				document.getElementById('increaseSlider').addEventListener('click', increaseSlider)
				window.addEventListener('devicemotion', handleMotion)
			}
		</script>
	</head>

	<body onload="activateSlider();">
		<pre class="output"></pre>

		<h1>Slider Motion Sensor Example</h1>

		<p>
			Open this slider on a device with a motion sensor, such as a smart phone or tablet. Rotate the device to adjust
			the slider value. The decrease and increase buttons also adjust the value.
		</p>
		<p>Note: This example may not work across all browsers.</p>

		<div>
			<button id="decreaseSlider" type="button">Decrease Value</button>
			<input type="range" min="1" max="100" value="50" id="motionSlider" disabled />
			<button id="increaseSlider" type="button">Increase Value</button>
			<p aria-live="polite">Slider Value: <span id="output">50</span></p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

### Failed
