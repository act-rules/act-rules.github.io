title: Visual context
key: visual-context

The visual context of some piece of information (*e.g.* an element) is everything that is visually located near it.

Visual context may include, and is not limited to, text in the same sentence or paragraph, headings, â€¦

The maximal "distance" between some information and its visual context depends on the precise situation, and on what kind of information is looked at (notably depending on the various piece of information that need context for differentiation between them). For example, the visual context for differentiating links in different paragraphs may include the full paragraph while the visual context for differentiation two fields in the same form is restricted to text immediately before or after the fields.
