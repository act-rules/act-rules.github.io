A modal dialog is an element which, until it is closed, prevents user interaction with any content on the web page that is not a descendant element of the modal.  Visually, a modal often (but not necessarily) appears on top of all other content of the [html web page][] and visually darkens or otherwise obscures that other content.

Modal dialogs are typically used to display important messages, prompts, or alerts that require the user's attention and prevent them from interacting with other parts of the page until they have addressed the issue at hand. They are "modal" because they create a temporary mode where the user is focused on the dialog and cannot interact with the rest of the page.
