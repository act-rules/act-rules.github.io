An element is hovered (by a pointing device) when that element matches the [`:hover` pseudo-class](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#hover-pseudo).

For HTML documents, see how the [`:hover` pseudo-class selector matches HTML elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics-other.html#selector-hover).
