# ACT Rules repository

The ACT Rules Community Group (previously known as Auto-WCAG), is an open forum set up to document and harmonise the interpretation of W3C accessibility standards, such as WCAG and WAI-ARIA, for testing purposes.

Visit the [ACT Rules website](https://auto-wcag.github.io/auto-wcag/) for the latest rules.
