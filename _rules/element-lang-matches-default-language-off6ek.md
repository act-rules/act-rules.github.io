## Applicability

This rule applies to any HTML element with a `lang` attribute for which all the following are true:

- the element is an [inclusive descendant][] in the [flat tree][] of a `body` element; and
- the element is in a [document][] with a [content type][] of `text/html`; and
- the element's `lang` [attribute value][] is a [valid language tag][]; and
- there is some non-empty [text inheriting its programmatic language][] from the element.

## Expectation

For each test target, the [primary language][] of its `lang` [attribute value][] is a [most common language][] of the test target.

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that user agents and assistive technologies can programmatically determine [valid language tags][] even if these do not conform to the [BCP 47][] syntax.

- This rule assumes that only [valid language tags][valid language tag] are enough to satisfy [Success Criterion 3.1.2 Language of Parts][sc312]; this notably excludes [grandfathered tags][] or [ISO 639.2][] three-letters codes, both having poor support in assistive technologies.

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

This rule checks that, if a `lang` attribute is used, its value is correct with respect to the content. This rule does not check whether a `lang` attribute should have been used or not. Especially, this rule does not check when `lang` attributes are missing. This must be tested separately and it is therefore possible to pass this rule without satisfying [Success Criterion 3.1.2 Language of Parts](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#language-of-parts).

- [Understanding Success Criterion 3.1.2: Language of Page][usc312]
- [H58: Using language attributes to identify changes in the human language](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H58)
- [BCP 47: Tags for Identifying Languages](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt)
- [The `lang` and `xml:lang` attributes](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-lang-and-xml:lang-attributes)

In all examples, the `html` element has itself a `lang` attribute in order to make sure that the examples satisfy [Success Criterion 3.1.1 Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#language-of-page). These `html` elements are, however, never applicable because they are not descendants of a `body` element, and the example descriptions do not mention them further.

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This `span` element has a `lang` [attribute value][] of `nl` (Dutch), which matches its [most common language][]. The most common language is Dutch because all words are Dutch.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>Dutch idioms</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>
			The Dutch phrase <span lang="nl">"Hij ging met de kippen op stok"</span> literally translates into "He went to
			roost with the chickens", but it means that he went to bed early.
		</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

The second `p` element has `lang` attribute value of `nl` (Dutch), which matches its [most common language][]. The most common language is Dutch because all English words are in `span` elements with a `lang` attribute value of `en`. Both `span` elements also have a `lang` attribute matching their most common language.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>Dutch idioms</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>Dutch idioms and their English meaning.</p>
		<p lang="nl">
			<span lang="en">The Dutch phrase</span> "Hij ging met de kippen op stok"
			<span lang="en"
				>literally translates into "He went to roost with the chickens", but it means that he went to bed early.</span
			>
		</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 3

This `div` element has a `lang` [attribute value][] of `en` (English), which matches its [most common language][]. The most common language is English because the accessible texts are English, and all other text is in a `p` element with a (correct) `lang` attribute value of `fr`.

```html
<html lang="fr">
	<head>
		<title>Feu d'artifice du nouvel an</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div lang="en">
			<img src="/test-assets/shared/fireworks.jpg" alt="Fireworks over Paris" />
			<p lang="fr">
				Bonne année !
			</p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 4

This `span` element has a `lang` [attribute value][] of `fr` (French), which matches one of its [most common languages][most common language]. The most common languages are both English and French because all the words belong to both languages.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<p>
		Even though all its words are English and it has meaning in English, the sentence
		<span lang="fr">Paul put dire comment on tape</span> is also a French sentence.
	</p>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 5

This `span` element has a `lang` [attribute value][] of `en` (English), which matches one of its [most common languages][most common language]. The most common languages are both English and French because all the words belong to both languages.

```html
<html lang="fr">
	<p>
		Bien que tous les ses mots soient français et qu'elle ait un sens en français, la phrase
		<span lang="en">Paul put dire comment on tape</span> est aussi une phrase anglaise.
	</p>
</html>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

This `span` element has `lang` attribute value of `fr` (French), which does not match its [most common language][]. The most common language is Dutch because all words are Dutch.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>Dutch idioms</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>
			The Dutch phrase <span lang="fr">"Hij ging met de kippen op stok"</span> literally translates into "He went to
			roost with the chickens", but it means that he went to bed early.
		</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 2

The second `p` element has `lang` attribute value of `en` (English), which does not match its [most common language][]. The most common language is Dutch because all English words are in `span` elements with a `lang` attribute value of `fr`. Both `span` elements also have an incorrect `lang` attribute in order to make sure that all targets in this example fail the rule.

```html
<html lang="nl">
	<head>
		<title>Met de kippen op stok</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<blockquote>
			<p>"Hij ging met de kippen op stok"</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p lang="en">
			<span lang="fr">The Dutch phrase</span> "Hij ging met de kippen op stok"
			<span lang="fr"
				>literally translates into "He went to roost with the chickens", but it means that he went to bed early.</span
			>
		</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 3

This `div` element has a `lang` attribute value of `fr` (French), which does not match its [most common language][]. The most common language is English because the accessible texts are English, and all other text is in a `p` element with a `lang` attribute value of `nl`, which also doesn't match its common language.

```html
<html lang="fr">
	<head>
		<title>Feu d'artifice du nouvel an</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div lang="fr">
			<img src="/test-assets/shared/fireworks.jpg" alt="Fireworks over Paris" />
			<p lang="nl">
				Bonne année !
			</p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 4

This `div` element has a `lang` attribute value of `fr` (French), which does not match its [most common language][]. The most common language is English because the accessible name of the `img` element is English. The `lang` attribute on the `p` element is effectively ignored. The `p` element is not applicable because there is no [text inheriting its programmatic language][] from it since its content is neither [visible][] nor [included in the accessibility tree][].

```html
<html lang="fr">
	<head>
		<title>Feu d'artifice du nouvel an</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div lang="fr">
			<img src="/test-assets/shared/fireworks.jpg" aria-labelledby="caption" />
			<p lang="en" id="caption" hidden>
				Fireworks over Paris
			</p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

There are no HTML elements in this document.

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" lang="en">
    <text x="0" y="0">I love ACT rules!</text>
</svg>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

There is no descendant of a `body` element with a `lang` attribute.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<body>
		<p>I love ACT rules!</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 3

This `p` element has an invalid language tag.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<body>
		<p lang="français">
			I love ACT rules!
		</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 4

There is no [text inheriting its programmatic language][] from the first `p` element because it has no content.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<body>
		<p lang="fr"></p>
		<p>I love ACT rules!</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 5

There is no [text inheriting its programmatic language][] from this `p` element because it has no content that is either [visible][] or [included in the accessibility tree][].

```html
<html lang="en">
	<body>
		<p lang="fr" hidden>I love ACT rules!</p>
	</body>
</html>
