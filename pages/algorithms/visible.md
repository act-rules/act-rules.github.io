Content perceivable through sight.

Content is considered visible, if making it fully transparent would result in a difference in the pixels rendered within any area of the viewport. This included pixels that are reached by scrolling.

[Content is defined in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-content).
