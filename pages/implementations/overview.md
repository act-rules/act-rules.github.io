The WCAG-ACT-RULES-CG rules are authored for reliable `WCAG` testing. 

In order to facilitate this goal each rule has a variety of test cases in the categories of `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`. 

Incorporating a rule from the WCAG-ACT-RULES-CG into your test tool, is considered an **implementation**. The test cases provided for the rules can be used to infer if an implementation yields the `expected` results.

In the spirit of Open source collaboration, we welcomes [contributions](/pages/contribute) of implementation statistics, to aid as a coverage metric of the rules. This in turn helps to improve the accuracy and completeness of both the rules and the test tools.

The sections [testcases](/pages/implementations/testcases), [reporting](/pages/implementations/reporting), [coverage](/pages/implementations/coverage) respectively, go into greater detail on the structure of a test case, tools for using the test cases, the anatomy of an implementation report and how to submit an implementation report, back to the community.
