A set of coordinates R is an _horizontal rectangle_ if there exist a coordinate _(x, y)_ and numbers _w_ and _h_ such that all coordinates _(a, b)_ with _x ⩽ a ⩽ x+w_ and _y ⩽ b ⩽ y+h_ are part of R.

R is then said to have corner _(x, y)_, width _w_, and height _h_.

Note that the rectangle is "horizontal" in the sense that its sides align with the axis of the coordinate system.
