A modal dialog is a type of user interface element that appears on top of the main content of a [html web page][] or application and requires the user to take some action or make a decision before they can continue interacting with the program.

Modal dialogs are typically used to display important messages, prompts, or alerts that require the user's attention and prevent them from interacting with other parts of the page until they have addressed the issue at hand. They are "modal" because they create a temporary mode where the user is focused on the dialog and cannot interact with the rest of the page.
