title: Visual context
key: visual-context

The visual context of some piece of information (_e.g._ an element) is everything that is visually or logically located near it. Only [visible](#visible) information may be part of the visual context.

Visual context may include, and is not limited to, text in the same sentence or paragraph, headings, â€¦

**Note**: Elements that are visually located further from the piece of information may still be considered as visual context if they both have a visual emphasise and are logically close to the piece of information (_e.g._ near it in the DOM tree). For example, a heading can be considered as visual context for its full textual content even though it might be located far away from the end of that content, and might even be off screen due to scrolling. But it has a strong logical connection with the content which indicate that it is giving context for all of it.
