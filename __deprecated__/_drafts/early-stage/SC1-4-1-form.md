Check if forms meet [[1.4.1 Use of Color]].
semi-automatable test

### Open issues
- Consider to connect this test to the user sample.
  - During the sampling the user is asked to select a page with a forms.
  - Afterwards the user answers the questions of this test.
- **Web page definition:** Some steps of this test are carried out after the form has been submitted, i.e. on the resulting page, which might have a different URL. How does this affect the sample? Can we model this as multi-page process? Is the resulting page added to the sample?
- Provide a clear description of “rely on color alone”, such as: For example a text cue is used on the form field.

## Background
- [F81: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.1 due to identifying required or error fields using color differences only](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140311/F81.html)
- [H92: Including a text cue for colored form control labels](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140311/H92.html)
- from the UWEM 2.0 draft:
- F81: Human input for sampling would be helpful to identify forms page.
- F81: Not programmatically determinable if a field is required or has an error. Interactive tests can not be done.

## Description
This test checks that there are other ways (apart from color differences) used to identify required fields, missing data, or incorrect data in a form.
*Note: This test will pass if the web page does not provide any feedback at all on the submitted data. (see also: Guideline 3.3 Input Assistance: Help users avoid and correct mistakes.)*

## Assumptions
- This test assumes that forms are implemented with `&lt;form&gt;` elements.

## Test procedure
1: no prior knowledge
Specify: Are there any additional requirements for the user profile?<br />The tester must be able to see the web page. This test can not be carried out by a blind person.
### Test subject
2: DOM tree (for tool)<br />4: rendered page (for user)
single page
### Selector (tool)
`form`
````
	**Open issue:** Limit the selection to forms with multiple input fields (not counting button, submit, and hidden input fields). Can this be described by a CSS selector?
````
### Step 1 (user)
*(Identification of required fields without form submission)*
Does the form (or surrounding text) contain any indication that some fields are required?
- IF no: continue with step 2.
- ELSE: Does the indication of required fields rely on color alone?
- IF no: continue with step 2.
- ELSE: Return FAILED.

### Step 2 (user)
*(Identification of missing data after form submission)*
Submit the form without filling in data. Does the resulting page contain any indication that data is missing?
- IF no: continue with step 3.
- ELSE: Does the indication of missing data rely on color alone?
- IF no: continue with step 3.
- ELSE: Return FAILED.

### Step 3 (user)
*(Identification of incorrect data after form submission)*
Enter incorrect data (such as letters in a field for a phone number) and submit the form. Does the resulting page contain any indication that data is incorrect?
- IF no: continue with step 4.
- ELSE: Does the indication of missing data rely on color alone?
- IF no: continue with step 4.
- ELSE: Return FAILED.
| Outcome  | Failed

### Step 4 (tool)
Return PASSED.

**Note**, that the test also passes, if the web page does not provide any feedback at all on the submitted data.
