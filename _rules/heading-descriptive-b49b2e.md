## Applicability

This rule applies to any element with the [semantic role][] of heading that is either [visible][] or [included in the accessibility tree][].

**Note:** This rule only applies to elements with the [semantic role][] of heading. Thus, it is a partial check for WCAG 2.0 success criterion 2.4.6, which applies to all headings. "Heading" is used in its general sense and includes headlines and other ways to add a heading to different types of content. This includes elements that are not marked up as headings in the code, but still act visually as headings, e.g. by larger and/or bolder text.

## Expectation 1

Each target element which is [visible][] describes the topic or purpose of the first [palpable content][] which is non-[decorative][], [visible][], and after the target in tree order in the [flat tree][].

## Expectation 2

Each target element which is [included in the accessibility tree][] describes the topic or purpose of the first [palpable content][] which is non-[decorative][], [included in the accessibility tree][], and after the target in tree order in the [flat tree][].

**Note:** Headings do not need to be lengthy. A word, or even a single character, may suffice.

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that the language of each test target can be correctly determined (either programmatically or by analyzing the content), and sufficiently understood.
- This rule assumes that the [flat tree][] order is close to the reading order, as elements are rendered on the page. Due to positioning, it is possible to render a document in a order that greatly differ from the tree order, in which case the content which is visually associated with a heading might not be the content following it in tree order and this rule might fail while [Success Criterion 2.4.6 Headings and Label][sc246] is still satisfied.

## Accessibility Support

Implementation of [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][] varies from one browser or assistive technology to another. Depending on this, some elements can have a [semantic role][] of `heading` and fail this rule with some technology but users of other technologies would not experience any accessibility issue.

## Background
