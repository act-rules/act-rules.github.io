A string of characters is considered text content if it contains one or more characters from the [letter or number categories of Unicode]( https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/ch04.pdf#G134153). This definition applies to the string as a whole, regardless of any other characters the string might contain.

**Note:** This definition is a heuristic implementation of the [WCAG definition of `text`](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-text). However, this definition differs from the WCAG `text` definition that also requires that "the sequence is expressing something in human language", which is not part of this definition.
