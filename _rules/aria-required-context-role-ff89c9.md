## Applicability

The rule applies to any HTML or SVG element that is [included in the accessibility tree][] and has a [WAI-ARIA 1.1][aria 1.1] [explicit semantic role][] with a [required context role][], except if the element has an [implicit semantic role][] that is identical to its [explicit semantic role][].

## Expectation

Each test target is [owned by][] an element that has a [semantic role][] that is one of the [required context roles][] of the target element.

## Assumptions

This rule assumes that the `role` attribute is used to give a [semantic role][] to the element according to ARIA specifications. If it is used for other purposes, and relationships between elements are already programmatically determinable by other means, it is possible to fail this rule but still satisfy [WCAG success criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships).

## Accessibility Support

- User agents do not all have the same accessibility tree. Particularly the method of deriving which element [owns][owned by] which other elements varies between browsers. This can lead to different results for this rule, depending on which accessibility tree is used as input.
- `aria-owns` has limited support in some user agents.
- There exist some combination of popular browsers and assistive technologies who do not announce correctly relationships based on a mix of [implicit][implicit role] and [explicit][explicit role] roles.

## Background

The applicability of this rule is limited to the [WAI-ARIA 1.1 Recommendation][aria 1.1] roles, since there are unresolved issues with how [Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module (DPUB ARIA) 1.0][dpub 1.0] uses role inheritance to define the [required context roles][], which makes it deviate from the model defined in [WAI-ARIA 1.1][aria 1.1]. The [WAI-ARIA Graphics Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/graphics-aria-1.0/) does not include any [required context roles][].

An example of an element that has an [implicit semantic role][] that is identical to its [explicit semantic role][] is a `<li role="listitem">` element. These elements are not applicable because they have extra requirements and should thus be checked separately.

The definition of [owned by][] used in this rule is different from the definition of ["owned element" in WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#dfn-owned-element).

[Subclass roles][subclass role] of [required context roles][] are not automatically included as possible [required context roles][]. For example, the [`feed`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#feed) role is not a possible [required context role][] for [`listitem`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#listitem), even though [`feed`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#feed) is a [subclass role][] of the [`list`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#list) role.

Some user agents try to correct missing [required context roles][] or incorrect [content model][]. This often results, for example, in an isolated list item being presented as part of a one-item list containing only itself. Therefore, most test cases contain several targets to try and circumvent these corrections in order to better demonstrate the issue.

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

These elements with an [explicit role][] of `listitem` are [owned by][] an element with their [required context role][], `list`, expressed as an [explicit role][].

```html
<div role="list">
	<div role="listitem">List item 1</div>
	<div role="listitem">List item 2</div>
</div>
```

#### Passed Example 2

These elements with an [explicit role][] of `listitem` are [owned by][] an element with their [required context role][], `list`, expressed as an [implicit role][] of `ul`. Note that this test case does not satisfy [Success Criterion 4.1.1 Parsing][sc411] because the [`ul` element][ul] does not respect its [content model][].

```html
<ul>
	<div role="listitem">List item 1</div>
	<div role="listitem">List item 2</div>
</ul>
```

#### Passed Example 3

These elements with an [explicit role][] of `listitem` are [owned by][] an element with their [required context role][] even though they are not direct DOM children of it. ARIA [ownership][owned by] "skips" through presentational nodes because they are not [included in the accessibility tree][].

```html
<div role="list">
	<div role="presentation">
		<div role="listitem">List item 1</div>
		<div role="listitem">List item 2</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

#### Passed Example 4

These elements with an [explicit role][] of `listitem` are [owned by][] an element with their [required context role][] even though they are not DOM descendants of it. The `aria-owns` attribute is used to alter the accessibility tree and place the target elements in their [required context role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#scope).

```html
<div role="list" aria-owns="item1 item2"></div>
<div id="item1" role="listitem">List item 1</div>
<div id="item2" role="listitem">List item 2</div>
```

#### Passed Example 5

These elements with an [explicit role][] of `listitem` are [owned by][] an element with their [required context role][] even though they are not direct DOM descendants of it. The `aria-owns` attribute is used to alter the accessibility tree and place the target elements in their [required context role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#scope).

```html
<div role="list" aria-owns="item1 item2">
	<div role="navigation">
		<div id="item1" role="listitem">List item 1</div>
		<div id="item2" role="listitem">List item 2</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

#### Passed Example 6

These elements with an [explicit role][] of `listitem` are [owned by][] an element with their [required context role][] because implicit [ownership][owned by] (inherited from DOM tree structure) crosses shadow boundaries.

```html
<div id="host" role="list"></div>

<script>
	const host = document.querySelector('#host')
	const root = host.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' })
	root.innerHTML = '<div role="listitem">List item 1</div> <div role="listitem">List item 2</div>'
</script>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

This element with an [explicit role][] of `listitem` is not [owned by][] an element with its [required context role][].

```html
<div role="listitem">List item 1</div>
```

#### Failed Example 2

These elements with an [explicit role][] of `listitem` are not [owned by][] an element with their [required context role][]. They are [owned by][] the `tabpanel` element, because it is the closest ancestor.

```html
<div role="list">
	<div role="tabpanel">
		<div role="listitem">List item 1</div>
		<div role="listitem">List item 2</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

#### Failed Example 3

These elements with an [explicit role][] of `listitem` are not [owned by][] an element with their [required context role][]. They are instead [owned by][] the `div` with an `aria-label` attribute; even though this `div` has no role, it has a global ARIA attribute and is thus [included in the accessibility tree][].

```html
<div role="list">
	<div aria-label="menu">
		<div role="listitem">List item 1</div>
		<div role="listitem">List item 2</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

#### Failed Example 4

These elements with an [explicit role][] of `listitem` are not [owned by][] an element with their [required context role][] because explicit [ownership][owned by] (set by `aria-owns`) does not cross shadow boundaries.

```html
<div role="list" aria-owns="item1 item2"></div>

<div id="host"></div>

<script>
	const host = document.querySelector('#host')
	const root = host.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' })
	root.innerHTML = '<div id="item1" role="listitem">List item 1</div> <div id="item2" role="listitem">List item 2</div>'
</script>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

This element with an [explicit role][] of `listitem` is not [included in the accessibility tree][].

```html
<div role="listitem" style="display:none;">List item 1</div>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

There is no element with an [explicit role][].

```html
<ul>
	<li>List item 1</li>
</ul>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 3

This `section` element with an [explicit role][] of `doc-biblioentry` has a role from the [Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module (DPUB ARIA) 1.0][dpub 1.0], not the [WAI-ARIA 1.1 Recommendation][aria 1.1].

```html
<section role="doc-bibliography">
	<h1>Cited Works</h1>
	<div role="list">
		<p role="doc-biblioentry" id="b8cab5dd-bc24-459c-9858-7afa9da69b64">
			John Steinbeck, The Grapes of Wrath (New York: The Viking Press, 1939)
		</p>
	</div>
</section>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 4

There is no element whose role has [required context role][] because the `header` role does not have one.

```html
<div role="header" aria-level="1">Hello!</div>
<p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 5

There is no element with an [explicit role][] different from its [implicit role][]. This `li` element has an [explicit role][] of `listitem` which is identical to its [implicit role][].

```html
<ul>
	<li role="listitem">List item 1</li>
</ul>
