A node is _perceivable content_ if all the following are true:

- the node is [palpable content][]; and
- the node is either [visible][] or [included in the accessibility tree][]; and
- if the node is an element, it does not have a [semantic role][] of `none` or `presentation`.

Perceivable content corresponds to nodes that contain information and are perceived by some categories of users.

#### Assumptions

This definition assumes that elements with a [semantic role][] of `none` or `presentation` are [pure decoration][] and that elements which are [pure decoration][] either are not [included in the accessibility tree][] or have a [semantic role][] of `none` or `presentation`. Note that if this is not the case, then [Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationship][sc131] is likely not satisfied.
