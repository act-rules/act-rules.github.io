## Applicability

This rule applies to any [WAI-ARIA state or property][] that is specified on an [HTML or SVG element][namespaced element] that is [included in the accessibility tree][].

## Expectation 1

For each test target, one of the following is true:

- **global**: the test target is a [global state or property][global]; or
- **semantic role**: the test target is an [inherited][], [supported][], or [required][] [state][] or [property][] of the [semantic role][] of the element on which the test target is specified; or
- **language feature**: the test target is specified on an [HTML element][namespaced element] and is allowed on that element. Which ARIA states or properties may be used on which element is described in [ARIA in HTML](https://w3c.github.io/html-aria/).

## Expectation 2

No test target is [prohibited][] on the [semantic role][] of the element on which it is specified.

## Assumptions

There are no assumptions.

## Accessibility Support

Implementation of [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][] varies from one browser or assistive technology to another. Depending on this, some elements can have a [semantic role][] of `none` and their attributes fail this rule with some technologies but users of other technology would not experience any accessibility issue.

## Background

The presence of prohibited ARIA attributes is often the result of a developer using an incorrect role, or a misunderstanding of the attribute. These attributes are ignored by browsers and other assistive technologies. This often means that a state or property which should exist is missing.

In HTML, there are language features that do not have corresponding implicit WAI-ARIA semantics. As per [ARIA in HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/), those elements can have [global states or properties][global]. Some of those elements can also have [inherited][], [supported][], or [required][] [states][state] or [properties][property] that correspond to a [WAI-ARIA role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#introroles). For example, the `audio` element has no corresponding ARIA semantics but it can have [inherited][], [supported][], or [required][] [states][state] or [properties][property] of the [`application` role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#application).

Assessing the value of the attribute is out of scope for this rule.

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

The `aria-pressed` [state][] is [supported][] with `button`, which is the [implicit role][] for `button` elements.

```html
<button aria-pressed="false">My button</button>
```

#### Passed Example 2

The `aria-pressed` [state][] is [supported][] with `button`, which is the [explicit role][] of this `div` element.

```html
<div role="button" aria-pressed="false">My button</div>
```

#### Passed Example 3

The `aria-busy` [state][] is a [global][] [state][] that is [supported][] by all elements, even without any [semantic role][].

```html
<div aria-busy="true">My busy div</div>
```

#### Passed Example 4

The `aria-label` [property][] is a [global][] [property][]. It is allowed on any [semantic role][], except where specifically prohibited.

```html
<div role="button" aria-label="OK">✓</div>
```

#### Passed Example 5

The `aria-checked` [state][] is [required][] for the [semantic][semantic role] `checkbox`.

```html
<div role="checkbox" aria-checked="false">My checkbox</div>
```

#### Passed Example 6

The `aria-controls` [property][] is [required][] for the [semantic][semantic role] `combobox`.

```html
<div role="combobox" aria-controls="id1" aria-expanded="false">My combobox</div>
```

#### Passed Example 7

The `aria-controls` [property][] is [required][] for the [semantic][semantic role] `combobox`. [WAI-ARIA states and properties][wai-aria state or property] with empty value are still applicable to this rule.

```html
<div role="combobox" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls>My combobox</div>
```

#### Passed Example 8

The `aria-controls` [property][] is [required][] for the [semantic][semantic role] `combobox`. [WAI-ARIA states and properties][wai-aria state or property] with empty value (specified as an empty string) are still applicable to this rule.

```html
<div role="combobox" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="">My combobox</div>
```

#### Passed Example 9

The `aria-label` [property][] is [global][]. It is allowed on any [semantic role][], except where specifically prohibited, including roles from the [WAI-ARIA Graphics Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/graphics-aria-1.0). This rule is applicable to SVG elements.

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="graphics-object" width="100" height="100" aria-label="yellow circle">
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```

#### Passed Example 10

This `button` element has an [explicit role][] of `none`. However, because it is [focusable][] (by default), it has a [semantic role][] of `button` due to [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][]. The `aria-pressed` [state][] is [supported][] for the `button` role.

```html
<button role="none" aria-pressed="false">ACT rules are cool!</button>
```

#### Passed Example 11

This `input` element does not have an [explicit role][] of `textbox`, but the `aria-required` property may be used on an `input` element with a `type` [attribute value][] of `password`.

```html
<label>Password<input type="password" aria-required="true"/></label>
```

#### Passed Example 12

This `div` element has an [explicit role][] of `switch`; the `aria-required` [property][] is [inherited][] from the `checkbox` superclass role.

```html
<div role="switch" aria-checked="false" tabindex="0" aria-required="true">
	<span class="label">Notifications</span>
	<span class="switch" style="position: relative; display: inline-block; top: 6px; border: 2px solid black; border-radius: 12px; height: 20px; width: 40px;">
		<span style="position: absolute; top: 2px; left: 2px; display: inline-block; border: 2px solid black; border-radius: 8px; height: 12px; width: 12px; background: black;"></span>
	</span>
	<span class="on" aria-hidden="true" style="display: none;">On</span>
	<span class="off" aria-hidden="true">Off</span>
</div>
```

#### Passed Example 13

This `div` element has an [explicit role][] of `separator`. The `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax` and `aria-valuenow` [properties][property] are [supported][] for the `separator` role when the element is [focusable][].

```html
<div role="separator" aria-valuenow="0" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100" tabindex="0">My separator</div>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

The `aria-sort` [property][] may not be used on a [semantic][semantic role] `button`.

```html
<button aria-sort="">Sort by year</button>
```

#### Failed Example 2

The `aria-orientation` property may not be used on `audio` element, nor can it be used on `application` (the [semantic role][] for which [inherited][], [supported][], or [required][] [states][state] or [properties][property] are also applicable to `audio` element).

```html
<audio src="/test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" controls aria-orientation="horizontal"></audio>
```

#### Failed Example 3

The `aria-label` property is [prohibited][] for an element with a `generic` role.

```html
<div aria-label="Bananas"></div>
```

#### Failed Example 4

The `aria-label` property is [prohibited][] for an element with a `paragraph` role.

```html
<div role="paragraph" aria-label="Bananas"></div>
```

#### Failed Example 5

The `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax` and `aria-valuenow` properties are not [supported][] for an element with a `separator` role that is not [focusable][].

```html
<div>ACT rules are cool!</div>
<div style="border: 1px solid #000;" role="separator" aria-valuenow="0" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"></div>
<div>ACT rules are useful!</div>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

This `div` element has no [WAI-ARIA state or property][].

```html
<div role="region">A region of content</div>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

This `div` element is not [included in the accessibility tree][], hence its [WAI-ARIA state or property][] is not checked.

```html
<div role="button" aria-sort="" style="display:none;"></div>
