title: Equivalent resource
key: equivalent-resource

Non-identical resources can still be equivalent by equally complying to the expectation formed by the user when navigating to them, thus serving an equivalent purpose. This would usually involve that the advertised key content is the same.

Web pages and documents (e.g. PDFs, office formats etc.) may be equivalent resources, even if the resources:

- are located on different URLs, including different domains
- present different navigation options, e.g. through bread crumbs or local sub menus
- contain different amounts of information and/or differently worded information
- use different layouts.

If all resources cover the user's expectations equally well, the resources are considered to be equivalent.

**Note:** The user's expectations for the resource can be formed by different things, e.g. the name of the link leading to the resource, with or without the context around the link. This depends on the accessibility requirement that is tested.

**Note:** If the same content is presented in different formats or languages, the format or language itself is often part of the purpose of the content, e.g. an article as both HTML and PDF, an image in different sizes, or an article in two different languages. If getting the same content in different formats or languages is the purpose of having seperate links, the resources are not equivalent.
