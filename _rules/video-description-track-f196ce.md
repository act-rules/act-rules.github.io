## Applicability

The rule applies to every [non-streaming](#non-streaming-media-element) `video` element that is [visible][] where the video contains audio and a `track` element with a `kind` [attribute value][] of `descriptions`.

## Expectation

The visual information of each test target not available through its audio is described with a description `track` element.

_Note_: Multiple description `track` elements may be useful for different languages, but at least one must match the language of the video.

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that a mechanism is available to start the video and that the video element is not simply used to display the [poster](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics-embedded-content.html#element-attrdef-video-poster).
- This rule assumes that the language of each test target can be correctly determined (either programmatically or by analyzing the content), and sufficiently understood.

## Accessibility Support

Currently the description track is not supported by most assistive technology. Accessibility support for the description track attribute is relatively low to non-existent. Video players may be able to work around the lack of support for the description track by using aria-live but few do this today.

This means that the rule can only provide a pass for these success criteria if assistive technology support the description track or if the video player that is used has implemented such a work around.

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

A video element with a track element that contains descriptions.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
		<track kind="descriptions" src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/descriptions.vtt" />
	</video>
</html>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

A video element with a track element that contains incorrect descriptions.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
		<track kind="descriptions" src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/incorrect-descriptions.vtt" />
	</video>
</html>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

A video element without a track element.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
	</video>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

A video element that is not [visible][].

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls style="display: none;">
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
		<track kind="descriptions" src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/descriptions.vtt" />
	</video>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 3

A video element without audio.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/silent.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/silent.webm" type="video/webm" />
		<track kind="descriptions" src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/descriptions.vtt" />
	</video>
</html>
```
