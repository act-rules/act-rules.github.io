The <dfn id="text-inheriting-language:text">text inheriting its programmatic language</dfn> from an element E is composed of all the following texts:

- **text nodes**: the value of any [text nodes][] that are [visible][] or [included in the accessibility tree][] and children of an element inheriting its programmatic language from E;
- **accessible text**: the [accessible name][] and [accessible description][] of any [element inheriting its programmatic language](#text-inheriting-language:element) from E, and [included in the accessibility tree][];
- **page title**: the value of the [document title][], only if E is a [document][] in a [top-level browsing context][].

An element F is an <dfn id="text-inheriting-language:element">element inheriting its programmatic language</dfn> from an element E if at least one of the following conditions is true (recursively):

- F is E itself (an element always inherits its programmatic language from itself); or
- F does not have a non-empty `lang` attribute, and is the child in the [flat tree][] of an element inheriting its programmatic language from E; or
- F is a [fully active][] [document][] element, has no non-empty `lang` attribute, and its [browsing context container][] is an element inheriting its programmatic language from E.
