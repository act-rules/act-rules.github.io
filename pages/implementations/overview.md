The WCAG-ACT-RULES-CG rules are authored for reliable `WCAG` testing.

In order to facilitate this goal each rule has a variety of test cases in the categories of `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`.

Incorporating a rule from the WCAG-ACT-RULES-CG into your test tool, is considered an **implementation**. The test cases provided for the rules can be used to infer if an implementation yields the `expected` results.

In the spirit of Open source collaboration, we welcomes [contributions](/pages/contribute) of implementation statistics, to aid as a coverage metric of the rules. This in turn helps to improve the accuracy and completeness of both the rules and the test tools.

Refer other section under implementations, which go into greater detail on the structure of a test case, tools for using the test cases, the anatomy of an implementation report and how to submit an implementation report, back to the community.
