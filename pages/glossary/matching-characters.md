A sequence of characters is considered to _match_ another if, after removing leading and trailing [space characters](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#white_space) and replacing remaining occurrences of one or more space characters with a single space, the two sequences of characters are equal character-by-character, ignoring any differences in letter casing.
