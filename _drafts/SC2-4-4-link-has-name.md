## Test procedure

### Applicability

The rule applies to any HTML or SVG element with the semantic role of `link` that are [visible on the page][] or [exposed to assistive technologies][].

**Note**: Roles can be [implicit](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#dfn-implicit-aria-semantics) through the element name or explicit through the [role attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/dom.html#aria-role-attribute).

### Expectation

Each target element has an [accessible name][] that is [non-empty][]

## Assumptions

- The rule assumes that all links are user interface components as defined by WCAG 2. When the link role is used incorrectly, this assumption may not be true.

## Accessibility Support

There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule.

## Background

- [https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/?showtechniques=244#navigation-mechanisms-refs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/?showtechniques=244#navigation-mechanisms-refs)
- [ARIA7: Using aria-labelledby for link purpose](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA7.html)
- [ARIA8: Using aria-label for link purpose](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA8.html)
- [F89: Failure of Success Criteria 2.4.4, 2.4.9 and 4.1.2 due to using null alt on an image where the image is the only content in a link](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F89.html)
- The WCAG 2.0 Techniques already contain examples and code snippets to illustrate which content passes or fails the test. Whenever possible auto-wcag refers to those. Another source for test cases is the W3C Before and After Demonstration.

## Test Cases

### Passed
```html
<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI"> Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) </a>
```

```html
<button role="link">Click me!</button>
```

### Failed

```html
<div>
  <p>
    Some detailed article, but the link to read more is placed with no relevance to the text, thereby the link has lost context.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="readmore.html">Read More...</a>
  </p>
</div>
```

```html
<table>
   <tr> 
       <td>Song: Ed Sheeran - Galway Girl.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
       <td>
        <a href="assets/download.html">
          Download Now
        </a>
       </td>
   </tr>
 </table>
```

### Inapplicable
```html
<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI" role="button">Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a>
```
