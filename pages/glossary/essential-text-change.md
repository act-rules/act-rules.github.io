An _essential text change_ occurs when the modification of the text content of an HTML element is necessary to convey accurate and timely information to the user. An _essential text change_ may appear in any of the following forms:

1. Providing context - Text is changed to provide users with additional information required to understand the current state of the page. For example, while searching for results, text may change to convey that the page is *loading* to provide context to the user.
2. Live updates of important information - The content automatically updates to show the most recent information available from a data source and should not be ignored by the user. For example, updates about the users browsing sessions status or important safety information like evacuation instructions in the case of a natural disaster would constitute an Essential Text Change. Oppositely, information such as stock prices or advertisements are not important information and would not be considered an Essential Text Change.
