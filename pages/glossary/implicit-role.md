The _implicit semantic role_ of an element is one way to give it a [semantic association][] by not specifying anything, and letting the host language decide of it (using a pre-defined default value that may depend on context).

Implicit roles for HTML and SVG, are documented in the [HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/#html-element-role-mappings) and the [SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/#mapping_role_table).
