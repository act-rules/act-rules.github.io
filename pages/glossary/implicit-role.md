The _Implicit Semantic Role_ is the [semantic role](#semantic-role) of each element that is used when no valid [explicit semantic role](#explicit-role) is specified. Elements with no [role attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#attr-aria-role), or with a [role attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/role-attribute/) containing no valid token, are mapped to their implicit role.

Implicit roles for HTML and SVG, are documented in the [HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/), the [ARIA in HTML (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/) documentation, and the [SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/).
