An element A is owned by element B if element A is a child of element B in the [accessibility tree](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/#input-aspects-accessibility).

> **Note:** This definition is different from the definition of ["owned element" in WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#dfn-owned-element). Because browsers have different accessibility trees, which element owns which other elements can vary between browsers. Until there is a standard accessibility tree, testing with multiple accessibility trees may be necessary.
