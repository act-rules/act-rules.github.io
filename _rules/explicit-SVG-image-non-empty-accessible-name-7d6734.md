## Applicability

The rule applies to any element in the [SVG](https://www.w3.org/2000/svg) namespace with an [explicit semantic role][explicit role] of either `img`, `graphics-document`, `graphics-symbol`, that is [included in the accessibility tree][].

## Expectation

Each target element has an [accessible name][] that is not empty.

## Assumptions

This rule assumes that the presence of one of the roles outlined in the applicability indicates the authors intent to include the element in the accessibility tree and thus convey information to the user about that element.

## Accessibility Support

The [HTML Accessibility API Mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#html-element-role-mappings) specify that the `<svg>` element has an implicit role of `graphics-document`. However browser support for the `graphics-document` role and the [SVG Accessibility API Mappings][] is inconsistent.

This rule is limited to the explicit use of roles, as a clear indication that content should convey meaning, until the [SVG Accessibility API Mappings][] is more stable and browser support is more consistent.

Browser and assistive technology support for SVG `<title>` and `<desc>` elements is currently inconsistent. Using WAI ARIA in combination with the `img` role for non-decorative `<svg>` elements significantly improves accessibility browser support.

Until browser support for the [SVG Accessibility API Mappings][] is more consistent it is recommended to explicitly remove decorative `<svg>` elements from the accessibility tree.

- [SVG Accessibility API Mappings (working draft)][svg accessibility api mappings]
- [WAI-ARIA Graphics Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/graphics-aria-1.0/)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This `svg` element has an [explicit role][] of `img` and an [accessible name][] from the `title` element that is not empty.

```html
<p>How many circles are there?</p>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img" width="100" height="100">
	<title>1 circle</title>
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```

#### Passed Example 2

This `circle` element has an [explicit role][] of `graphics-symbol` and an [accessible name][] from the `aria-label` attribute that is not empty.

```html
<p>How many circles are there?</p>
<svg xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
	<circle
		role="graphics-symbol"
		cx="50"
		cy="50"
		r="40"
		stroke="green"
		stroke-width="4"
		fill="yellow"
		aria-label="1 circle"
	></circle>
</svg>
```

#### Passed Example 3

This `svg` element has an [explicit role][] of `graphics-document` and an [accessible name][] from the `title` element that is not empty.

```html
<p>How many circles are there?</p>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="graphics-document" width="100" height="100">
	<title>1 circle</title>
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

This `svg` element has an [explicit role][] of `img` but has no [accessible name][].

```html
<p>How many circles are there?</p>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img">
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```

#### Failed Example 2

This `svg` element has an [explicit role][] of `img`, is included in the accessibility tree, but it has no [accessible name][] because the `title` element is empty.

```html
<p>How many circles are there?</p>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img">
	<title></title>
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```

#### Failed Example 3

This `circle` element has an [explicit role][] of `graphics-symbol` but has no [accessible name][].

```html
<p>How many circles are there?</p>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
	<circle role="graphics-symbol" cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

Neither the `svg` element nor the `circle` element has any of the three [explicit roles][explicit role] of `img`, `graphics-document`, `graphics-symbol`.

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

This `svg` element and its descendants are not [included in the accessibility tree][] because of the `aria-hidden` attribute.

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img" aria-hidden="true">
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 3

This `circle` element has an [explicit role][] that is neither `img`, `graphics-document` nor `graphics-symbol`.

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
	<circle role="graphics-object" cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```
