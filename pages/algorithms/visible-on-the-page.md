An element is considered visible if the element generates one or more [layout boxes](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view/#layout-box) with non-zero surface areas, is not fully transparent, resides within an area of the viewport that can be reached via scrolling, and either has no [parent](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-tree-parent) or has a [parent](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-tree-parent) that itself is visible.
