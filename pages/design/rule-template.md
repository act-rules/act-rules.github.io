title: Auto-WCAG Rule Template
---

The rule template contains a plain language description of the rule, some background information, and a list of all assumptions. The test procedure is defined by the selector, a number of steps and a description of the possible outcomes.

Use the [empty test template](rule-template-empty.md) to create new auto-wcag rule. When creating a new rule, first read [rule design](rule-design.md).

## Description

This rule checks ...

## Background

- Links to Techniques for WCAG 2.0
- Latest version: Techniques for WCAG 2.0 W3C Working Group Note 8 April 2014
- Link to other methodologies, test specifications or tools
- Links to test cases, test suites, unit tests, etc.
- The WCAG 2.0 Techniques already contain examples and code snippets to illustrate which content passes or fails the test. Whenever possible auto-wcag refers to those. Another source for test cases is the W3C Before and After Demonstration.
