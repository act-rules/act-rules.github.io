The colors of all the pixels of a [visible](#visible) chararacter in a [text node](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#text) that change color when the CSS `color` property is changed. This includes anti-aliased pixels.

**Note:** Anti-aliasing is a technique in which the forground color and background color are blended to create smooth edges.
