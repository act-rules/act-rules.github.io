## Applicability

This rule applies to any `iframe` element that has a negative number as a `tabindex` [attribute value][].

## Expectation

For each test target, the [nested browsing context][] does not include elements that are [visible][] and part of the [sequential focus navigation][]. An element is "included" in a [nested browsing context][] if its [owner document][] is the [container document][] of the [nested browsing context][]. 

## Assumptions

This rule assumes that interactive content inside `iframe` elements is used to provide functionality. If the interactive content does not provide functionality, for example a button that does nothing when clicked, [success criterion 2.1.1][sc211] may be satisfied, even if the rule is failed.

## Accessibility Support

There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule.

## Background

By setting the `tabindex` [attribute value][] of an `iframe` element to `-1` or some other negative number, it becomes impossible to move the focus into the [browsing context][nested browsing context] of the `iframe` element. Even though its content is still included in the [sequential focus navigation][], there is no way to move the focus to any of the items in the `iframe` using standard keyboard navigation.

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This `iframe` element contains no content that is part of [sequential focus navigation][].

```html
<iframe tabindex="-1" srcdoc="<h1>Hello world</h1>"></iframe>
```

#### Passed Example 2

This `iframe` element contains a link that, because of its `tabindex` is not part of [sequential focus navigation][].

```html
<iframe tabindex="-1" srcdoc="<a href='/' tabindex='-1'>Home</a>"></iframe>
```

#### Passed Example 3

This `iframe` element contains no [visible][] content because of the small size of the iframe.

```html
<iframe tabindex="-1" width="1" height="1" srcdoc="<a href='/'>Home</a>"></iframe>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

This `iframe` element has a link that is part of [sequential focus navigation][].

```html
<iframe tabindex="-1" srcdoc="<a href='/'>Home</a>"></iframe>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

This `iframe` element does not have a `tabindex` [attribute value][] that is a negative number

```html
<iframe tabindex="0" srcdoc="<a href='/'>Home</a>"></iframe>
```
