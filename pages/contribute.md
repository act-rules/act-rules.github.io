title: Contribute to Auto-WCAG
---

Auto-WCAG is a group open to anyone interested in accessibility, accessibility testing or automated testing. We welcome contributions from anyone, either though Github issues and pull requests, or by contribution to our monthly teleconferences.

## Leave your feedback on GitHub

Contributing is open to anyone. We welcome any pull requests for changes. We ask that you make changes to pull requests **only for drafts**. Before contributing new rules, we recommend you checked their validity with several experienced accessibility auditors first. This helps you identify potential stumbling blocks early in their design.
