Non-text content is any content that is not a sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined or where the sequence is not expressing something in human language.

Images are examples of non-text content that is not a sequence of chararacters that can be programatically determined. 

Using the letter character "X" as a symbol for "close", or symbol characters to create emojis, e.g. ";-)", are examples of sequences of characters that are programatically determinable, but do not express something in human language.
