## Mailing list

By becoming a member you will be added to the mailing list, which does not have much traffic (approximately 2-3 emails per week). You will receive the latest updates and meeting invites etc. You will also receive "final call" e-mails. These are announcements of changes (new rules, correction to existing ones, etc.) that have been approved by other members, and will be published if there is no unresolved feedback.

## Slack

The ACT-Rules community is active in the #act-rules channel on the W3C Community Slack. To join, you will need to [sign up for the W3C community Slack](https://w3ccommunity.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-drq1eer6-MlZgOJOWVAEV1UTp66ywAQ#/). Once you have signed up, you can join by visiting [w3ccommunity.slack.com](https://w3ccommunity.slack.com/).

## Meetings

The Community Group has conference calls twice a month. Usually, the first call is on the **second Thursday of the month** from [16:00 to 17:00 Central European Time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=ACT-R+call&iso=20200813T16&p1=16&ah=1&am=00), and the second monthly call is on every **fourth Thursday of the month** from [10:00 to 11:00 Central European Time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=ACT-R+call&iso=20200827T10&p1=16&ah=1&am=00).

Participating in our conference calls is the easiest way to become an active contributor, get to know the other members of the Community Group, and learn from the shared pool of knowledge held by the accessibility experts in the group.

The invitation and agenda for these meetings is sent out through the mailing list a few days in advance. The dates for the next 5 meetings can also be found on the agenda.
