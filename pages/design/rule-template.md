title: Auto-WCAG Rule Template
---

The rule template contains a plain language description of the rule, some background information, and a list of all assumptions. The test procedure is defined by the selector, a number of steps and a description of the possible outcomes.

Use the [empty atomic rule template](atomic-template-empty.html) to create new auto-wcag rule. When creating a new rule, first read [rule design](rule-design.html).

## Test procedure

### Applicability

The rule applies to any (??) element ...

### Expectation (1)

Each target element ...

### Expectation 2

Each target element [that meets expectation 1, and] ...

## Assumptions

- Make a list

## Accessibility Support

Support for XXX is known to be limited in some assistive technologies. If any of those assistive technologies is part of the accessibility support baseline of a test, any applicable element must **fail** this rule.

## Background

- Links to Techniques for WCAG 2.0
- Latest version: Techniques for WCAG 2.0 W3C Working Group Note 8 April 2014
- Link to other methodologies, test specifications or tools
- Links to test cases, test suites, unit tests, etc.
- The WCAG 2.0 Techniques already contain examples and code snippets to illustrate which content passes or fails the test. Whenever possible auto-wcag refers to those. Another source for test cases is the W3C Before and After Demonstration.

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Pass example 1

Briefly describe what passed in the html code below

```html
<!-- passing html code snippet -->
```

#### Pass example X

... Add one test case for each "reason" an element can pass

### Failed

#### Failure example 1

Briefly describe what failed in the html code below

```html
<!-- failing html code snippet -->
```

#### Failure example X

... Add one test case for each "reason" an element can fail

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable example 1

Briefly describe why the html code snippet is inapplicable

```html
<!-- inapplicable code snippet -->
```

#### Inapplicable example X

... Add one test case for each "reason" an element can be inapplicable

## Composite rules

Composite rules are rules that take results from different rules and through some logic come to a single result. For example: SC 1.2.3 allows video to pass with either a transcript, an audio description, or if it is a media alternative. Each of these would be atomic rules, that are used in a composite rule. The composite rule than describes that at least one of these must pass for the composite rule to pass.

For more about composite rules, see the [ACT Rules Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#composed-rules). To create a composite rule, use the [empty composite rule template](./composite-template-empty.html).
