An element is _shape-shifted_ is the [computed value][] of it has an [inclusive ancestor][] in the [flat tree][] with any of its [shape-shifting properties][] different from the [initial value][] of that property.

The <dfn id="shape-shifted-element:properties">Shape-Shifting Properties</dfn> are the following CSS properties:

- `border-radius` and the associated longhands;
- `transform`;
- `rotate`;
- `clip`;
- `clip-path`;

#### Background

Shape-shifted elements have an actual area on screen that can be very different from a rectangle aligned with the screen edges, and therefore hard to precisely compute. Rules looking at this area ignore shape-shifted elements for the sake of simplicity.

Not all shape-shifting properties significantly change the shape of an element. For example, a rotation of 180Â°, a `transform` property defining only the `translate` function, or a `clip-path` along a rectangular shape would not really alter the shape. This definition ignores these for the sake of simplicity.

Other CSS properties may alter the area covered by an element, for examples `height` or `width`. These properties, however, do not alter the _shape_ (rectangle aligned with the edges) and tend to keep the covered area and the CSS box model in harmony. Therefore, this definition doesn't include them.
