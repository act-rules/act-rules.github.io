ACT Rules can be implemented in automated test tools and test methodologies. Tools and methodologies based on the same set of rules will produce (largely) the same results. Each rule includes a number of test cases that are used to check if an implementation is correct. The ACT Rules Community keeps a list of implementations that are actively implementing ACT Rules. By comparing how many implementations rules have, we work out which rules are widely agreed upon, and which ones need further discussion.

## Contribute An Implementation

If you developed an accessibility tool or a testing methodology, and would like to have your implementation included in the ACT-Rules website, there are two ways you can do so.

1. If you have a tool that can return a data format, you will need to run your tests against the [ACT-R test cases](../testcases/) and [submit a report](../reporting/).

2. If you have a manual test methodology where you fill results into some report template or semi-automated tool, you can [use the ACT Implementor tool](https://act-implementor.netlify.app/#/) instead to produce implementation reports.
