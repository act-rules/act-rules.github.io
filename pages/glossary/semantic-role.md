A _semantic [role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#dfn-role)_ is a semantic association that indicates an object's type, as defined by a standard such as the [WAI-ARIA spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions), [Graphics AAM spec](https://w3c.github.io/graphics-aam/#mapping_role_table), or similar. This allows tools to present and support interaction with the object in a manner that is consistent with user expectations about other objects of that type.

The semantic role of an element is its [explicit semantic role](#explicit-role) if it has any, otherwise, the [implicit semantic role](#implicit-role) is used.
