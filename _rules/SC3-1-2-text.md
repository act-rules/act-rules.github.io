## Description

This test checks that changes in human language are marked up correctly in the web content.

## Background

- [H58: Using language attributes to identify changes in the human language](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140408/H58)
- [eGovMon test for SC3.1.2](http://wiki.egovmon.no/wiki/SC3.1.2#Element_self::text.28.29)
- [BCP 47: Tags for the Identification of Languages](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt)
- [HTML 4.01 Inheritance of language codes](http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/struct/dirlang.html#h-8.1.2)

## Assumptions

- The comparison of language-code does not look for exact matches. Technique H57 states: "Use of the primary code is important for this technique." which means that region subtags can be ignored in the comparison, i.e. "en-GB" is the same as "en".
- This test applies only to visible text, i.e. the text of `alt` or `title`-attributes is not checked. `alt` attributes are covered by 1.1.1 Non-text Content.
- Single words in another language do not have to be marked as language changes.
- This test assumes that the language of the web content has been specified in the `lang` attribute of the element (see also [SC3-1-2-lang](SC3-1-2-lang.html)). The `xml:lang` attribute is not taken into account because tests have shown, that `xml:lang` is ignored by screenreaders.

## Test procedure

### Selector

Select consecutive run of text to which a single language attribute applies.

L1 = language of the selected text as determined by [HTML 4.01 Inheritance of language codes](http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/struct/dirlang.html#h-8.1.2).

*Note*: This test is applied to natural language text. The test is not applicable to content of `script` elements, attribute values, and text contained in HTML comments.

### Step 1

Use a [language identification algorithm][LANGFND] to determine L2 = the language actually used in the selected text.

If L2 can not be determined by the algorithm.

Continue with [Step 2](#step-2).

If L2 is equal to L1, return [step1-pass](#step1-pass)

Else return [step1-fail](#step1-fail)

### Step 2

Present the selected text to the user.

If the user is not available, return [step2-cannottell](#step2-cannottell)

**User Input Question:**

| Property     | Value
|--------------|---------
| highlight    | 
| question     | Is L1 the *only* language used in this text?
| help         | If the text contains a phrase or sentence in another language, please answer "no". If there are only single words in another language and the rest of the text is in L1, please answer "yes".
| user_profile | Understand the languages used in the text.
| context      | yes
| interaction  | no

*Note that language codes should be presented in human readable form, e.g. using the description from the [language subtag registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry).*

If yes, return [step2-pass](#step2-pass)

Else return [step2-fail](#step2-fail)

## Outcome

The resulting assertion is as follows,

| Property | Value
|----------|----------
| type     | Assertion
| test     | auto-wcag:{{ page.rule_id }}
| subject  | *the selected element*
| mode     | auto-wcag:{{ page.test_mode }}
| result   | <One TestResult from below>

### step1-pass

| Property    | Value
|-------------|----------
| type        | TestResult

### step1-fail

| Property    | Value
|-------------|----------
| type        | TestResult
| outcome     | Failed
| description | The language of the text is not specified correctly.

### step2-cannottell

| Property    | Value
|-------------|----------
| type        | TestResult
| outcome     | CannotTell
| description | It is not possible to determine if the language of the text is specified correctly.

### step2-pass

| Property    | Value
|-------------|----------
| type        | TestResult
| outcome     | Passed
| description |

### step2-fail

| Property    | Value
|-------------|----------
| type        | TestResult
| outcome     | Failed
| description | The language of the text is not specified correctly.
