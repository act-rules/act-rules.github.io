## Applicability

This rule applies to any [HTML web page][].

## Expectations

In each test target, either there is no [non-repeated content after repeated content][] or there exists an element for which all the following are true:

- the element is [non-repeated content after repeated content][]; and
- the element has a [semantic role][] of `heading`; and
- the element is [visible][]; and
- the element is [included in the accessibility tree][].

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that headings used to pass [Technique H69: Providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content][tech h69] have to be [included in the accessibility tree][] in order to be beneficial to users of assistive technologies.
- This rule assumes that the first non-repeated content is starting a new section of content. If this is not the case, it is possible to fail the rule while still passing [Technique H69: Providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content][tech h69].

## Accessibility Support

- Having a heading for the non-repeated content is sufficient to pass [Success Criterion 2.4.1: Bypass blocks][sc241]. However, if headings are used for that goal, they will only benefit users who can actually navigate from heading to heading (such a functionality can be provided by browsers, browsers plugins, screen readers or other assistive technologies). Users without any possibility for headings navigation will be left without way of bypassing blocks of repeated content and will still experience accessibility issues. Therefore, it is recommended to provide other ways of bypassing blocks.
- When headings are rendered without sufficient visual cues, they are not perceived as headings by sighted users. In this case, passing this rule might still fail [Technique H69: Providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content][tech h69] and [Success Criterion 2.4.1: Bypass blocks][sc241]. Additionally, this is likely a failure of [Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships][sc131].

## Background

The intention of this rule is that the heading is at (or near) the start of the main area of content of a document. However, defining the main area of content in a non-ambiguous way is not really doable. Therefore, the rule takes a more lenient position and only requires the heading to be some non-repeated content. Additional conditions on this heading were considered and rejected when writing the rule since it might be acceptable, for example, to have non-repeated content such as breadcrumb before any heading. Therefore, it is possible to pass this rule but still fail [H69: Providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content][tech h69] and violate [Success Criterion 2.4.1: Bypass blocks][sc241].

Neither this rule, nor technique [H69: Providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content][tech h69], expects the heading to accurately describe its corresponding section. However, having non descriptive headings fails [Success Criterion 2.4.6: Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#headings-and-labels)

- [Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.1: Bypass Blocks][usc241]
- [H69: Providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content][tech h69]
- [CSS Scoping (work in progress)](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/)

To avoid using landmarks for the non-repeated content, which would satisfy [Success Criterion 2.4.1 Bypass Block][sc241], which this rule is designed for, this rule uses `<div id="main">` in its test cases to indicate where non-repeating content exists. It is recommended to use the `main` landmark instead. The `nav` element is a [block of repeated content][] due to the link inside it to a page with similar [blocks of content][block of content].

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This [document][] has a `h1` heading, which is [visible][] and [included in the accessibility tree][], at the beginning of its non-repeated content.

			</ol>
		</nav>

		<div id="main">
			<h1>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>

	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 3

This [document][] has a `h1` heading, which is [visible][] and [included in the accessibility tree][], at the beginning of its non-repeated content.

**Note:** In this [document][], the non-repeated content starts after the `ol` element.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<!-- Navigational block of content starts here -->
		<h1>Content</h1>
		<ol>
			<li><a>Chapter 1</a></li>
			<li><a href="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/chapter2.html">Chapter 2</a></li>
		</ol>
		<!-- Navigational block of content ends here -->

		<!-- Main block of content starts here -->
		<h1>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
		<p>
			Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of
			time.
		</p>
		<!-- Main block of content ends here -->
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 4

This [document][] has a `h1` heading, which is [visible][] and [included in the accessibility tree][], at the beginning of its non-repeated content. Here, the heading is the first [non-repeated content after repeated content][].

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<nav id="chapters-navigation">
			<h1>Content</h1>
			<ol>
				<li><a>Chapter 1</a></li>
				<li><a href="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/chapter2.html">Chapter 2</a></li>
			</ol>
		</nav>

		<div id="main">
			<hr />
			<h1>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
			</p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 5

This [document][] has a `h1` heading, which is [visible][] and [included in the accessibility tree][], at the beginning of its non-repeated content.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<nav id="chapters-navigation">
			<h1>Content</h1>
			<ol>
				<li><a>Chapter 1</a></li>
				<li><a href="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/chapter2.html">Chapter 2</a></li>
			</ol>
		</nav>

		<div id="main">
			<img src="../test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/peach-garden-oath.jpg" alt="" />
			<h1>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
			</p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 6

This [document][] has a `div` element with a role of `heading`, which is [visible][] and [included in the accessibility tree][], at the beginning of its non-repeated content. Note that re-purposing an element instead of using native HTML is a violation of the [First Rule of ARIA Use](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1) and should normally be avoided.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<nav id="chapters-navigation">
			<div role="heading" aria-level="1">Contents</div>
			<ol>
				<li><a>Chapter 1</a></li>
				<li><a href="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/chapter2.html">Chapter 2</a></li>
			</ol>
		</nav>

		<div id="main">
			<div role="heading" aria-level="1">Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</div>
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
			</p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 7

This [document][] has a `h1` heading, which is [visible][] and [included in the accessibility tree][], at the beginning of its non-repeated content.

	</head>
	<body>
		<nav id="chapters-navigation">
			<h1>Content</h1>
			<ol>
				<li><a>Chapter 1</a></li>
				<li><a href="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/chapter2.html">Chapter 2</a></li>
			</ol>
		</nav>

		<div id="main">
			<h1>
				<img
					src="../test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/peach-garden-oath.jpg"
					alt="Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden"
				/>
			</h1>
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
			</p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 8

This [document][] has a `h1` heading, which is [visible][] and [included in the accessibility tree][], at the beginning of its non-repeated content.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<nav id="chapters-navigation">
			<h1>Content</h1>
			<ol>
				<li><a>Chapter 1</a></li>
				<li><a href="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/chapter2.html">Chapter 2</a></li>

				of time.
			</p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 9

This [document][] has no [non-repeated content after repeated content][].

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>
			Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of
			time.
		</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

In this document, there is no element with a [semantic role][] of `heading`, even though the `strong` element is styled to appear as one.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<nav id="chapters-navigation">
			<ol>
				<li><a>Chapter 1</a></li>
				<li><a href="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/chapter2.html">Chapter 2</a></li>
			</ol>
		</nav>

		<div id="main">
			<strong style="font-size: 18pt">Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</strong>
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
			</p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 2

The non-repeated content of this [document][] starts with a `h1` heading, but it is not [visible][] (because it is off-screen).

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="../test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/styles.css" />
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<nav id="chapters-navigation">
			<ol>
				<li><a>Chapter 1</a></li>
				<li><a href="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/chapter2.html">Chapter 2</a></li>
			</ol>
		</nav>

		<div id="main">
			<h1 class="off-screen">Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
			</p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 3

The non-repeated content of this [document][] starts with a `h1` heading, but it is not [included in the accessibility tree][] (because of the `aria-hidden` attribute).

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<nav id="chapters-navigation">
			<ol>
				<li><a>Chapter 1</a></li>
				<li><a href="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/chapter2.html">Chapter 2</a></li>
			</ol>
		</nav>

		<div id="main">
			<h1 aria-hidden="true">Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
			</p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 4

In this [document][], the only element with a role of `heading` is inside a [block of repeated content][] and therefore isn't [non-repeated content after repeated content][].

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<nav id="chapters-navigation">
			<h1>Content</h1>
			<ol>
				<li><a>Chapter 1</a></li>
				<li><a href="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/chapter2.html">Chapter 2</a></li>
			</ol>
		</nav>

		<div id="main">
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
			</p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```
