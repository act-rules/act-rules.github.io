Editorial note:
This is a placeholder file (to get passing test). The definition is onboarded as part of PR #555:
https://github.com/act-rules/act-rules.github.io/blob/link-is-descriptive/pages/glossary/programmatically-determined-context.md

As much as possible, I'd like to keep the discussion on this definition there, in order to avoid having the two definitions drifting. I agree that this is not ideal for reviewing and apologise for that.
Depending on which PR is faster to move on, the full definition might need to be onboarded here when Final Call start.
