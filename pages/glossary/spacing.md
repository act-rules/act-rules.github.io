The _spacing_ from a set of coordinates A to another set B, is the largest distance _d_ (in that coordinate system) such that all the following are true for the circle of diameter _d_ centered at the center of A:

- the circle contains no point of B; and
- either B contains an [horizontal rectangle][] with width and height at least _d_, or the circle does not intersect a similar circle of diameter \_d_centered at the center of B.

Where the _center_ of a set of coordinate is the intersection of the diagonals of the smallest [horizontal rectangle][] that contains the set.

> **Note:** the vocabulary used here refer to 2-dimensional coordinate systems but naturally expand to higher dimensions.
