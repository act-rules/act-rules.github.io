title: Equivalent purpose 
key: equivalent-purpose 
---

Resources that are not identical can still serve an equivalent purpose by both/all living up to the expectation that was created when sending the user to the resources. This would usually involve that the advertised key content is the same.  

Web pages and documents (e.g. PDFs, office formats etc.) may however fulfil an equivalent purpose, even if the resources:
* are located on different URLs, including different domains
* present different navigation options, e.g. through bread crumbs or local sub menus
* contain different amounts of information and/or differently worded information
* use different layouts.

If both/all resources cover the user expectations created by e.g. the link name equally well, the resources are considered to serve an equivalent purpose. 

**Note:** If the same content is presented in different formats, the format itself is often part of the link purpose, e.g. an article as both HTML and PDF, or an image in different sizes. If getting the same content in different formats is the purpose of having seperate links, the resources do not serve an equivalent purpose.
