Element L is a _programmatic label_ of target element T if either:

- T is a [labeled control][] of L; or
- L is referenced by ID in the `aria-labelledby` attribute of T.

For more details, see [examples of programmatic label](/pages/examples/programmatic-label/).

**Note**: a given element may have more than one programmatic label.
