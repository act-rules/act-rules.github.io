title: Auto-WCAG Community Group
---

The Automated WCAG Monitoring community group, founded in 2014, is a W3C community with the focused to develop reliable [rules](pages/rules.html) for WCAG testing, both automated and semi-automated. We aim to assist developers of test tools to improve the accuracy and completeness of their tools.

Creating (semi-)automated [rules](pages/rules.html) to tests WCAG is key to affordable, large scale research. These rules are designed in a way that they are usable by people with a variety of skills. The results too should be informative, not just to developers, but to website managers, policy makers and disability advocates and other interested parties.

## Related W3C Activities

The Auto-WCAG Community Group is the primary contributor of rules to the Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Taskforce for the W3C. The ACT Taskforce is currently developing the standard around which rules can be created, and is planning to put together a suite of rules on how WCAG 2 (and beyond) should be tested.
