title: Clipped by Overflow

unambiguous: true

A [node][] with an [ancestor][] in the [flat tree][] with a [computed][] [overflow][] of `none` or `clipped`, where
changing the [overflow][] of all such [ancestors][ancestor] to `visible` would cause more of the [node][] to become [visible][].

#### Example of clipped by overflow

This `img` element has an [ancestor][] `div` element with an `overflow` of `none` (both `overflow-x` and `overflow-y`). The height of the `img` is greater than that of the [ancestor][] `div`, and so is clipped by the `overflow` property of the `div`.


```html
<div style="height: 100px; overflow: none;">
	<img src="/test-assets/w3c-logo.png" height="150" alt="Partial W3C Logo" />
</div>
```
