## Applicability

The root element of the [web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s), if it is an `html` element.

**Note:** Documents embedded into other documents, such as through `iframe` or `object` elements are not applicable and do not require page titles, because they are not web pages according to the definition in WCAG.

## Expectation 1

Each target element has at least one [descendant](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-descendant) that is an HTML `title` element.

**Note:** The `title` element exists in other namespaces such as SVG. These are not HTML `title` elements and should be ignored for this rule.

**Note:** The [HTML specification - The `title` element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-title-element) requires that a document only has one `title` element, and that it is a child of the `head` element of a document. However, HTML 5.2 also describes what should happen in case of multiple titles, and titles outside the `head` element. Because of this, neither of these validation issues causes a conformance problem for WCAG.

## Expectation 2

For each target element, the first HTML `title` element that is a [descendant](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-descendant) of the [document element](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#document-element) has [children](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-child) that are [text nodes](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#text) that are not only [whitespace](#whitespace).

## Assumptions

_There are currently no assumptions_
