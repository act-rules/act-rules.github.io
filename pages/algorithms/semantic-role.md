title: Semantic Role 
key: semantic-role
---

A semantic association that indicates an object's type. This allows tools to present and support interaction with the object in a manner that is consistent with user expectations about other objects of that type.

[Roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#dfn-role) can be [implicit](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#implicit_semantics) through the element type or explicit through the [role attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#aria-role-attribute). 

**Note**: For HTML elements the implicit roles are documented in [ARIA in HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/).
