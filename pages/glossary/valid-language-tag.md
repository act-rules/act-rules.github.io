A [language tag][] is _valid_ if its [primary language subtag][] exists in the [language subtag registry][] with a [Type field][] whose field-body value is `language`.

A "language tag" is here to be understood as in the first paragraph of the [BCP 47 language tag syntax][language tag], i.e. a sequence of subtags separated by hyphens, where a subtag is any sequence of alphanumerical characters. Thus, this definition intentionally differs from the strict [BCP 47 syntax][language tag] (and ABNF grammar) as user agents and assistive technologies are more lenient in what they accept. The definition is however consistent with the behavior of the `:lang()` pseudo-selector as defined by [Selectors Level 3][]. For example, `de-hello` would be an accepted way to indicate German in current user agents and assistive technologies, despite not being valid according to [BCP 47 grammar][language tag]. As a consequence of this definition, however, [grandfathered tags][] are not correctly recognized as valid language subtags.

Subtags, notably the [primary language subtag][], are [case insensitive][]. Hence comparison with the [language subtag registry][] must be done in a case insensitive way.
