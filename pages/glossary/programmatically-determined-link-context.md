The _programmatically determined context_ of a link (or _programmatically determined link context_) is the set of all elements that are [included in the accessibility tree][], and have one or more of the following relationships to the link:

- being an [ancestor][] of the link in the [flat tree][] with a [semantic role][] of `listitem`; or
- being the closest [ancestor][] of the link in the [flat tree][] that is a `p` element; or
- being the closest [ancestor][] of the link in the [flat tree][] that has a [semantic role][] of `cell` or `gridcell`; or
- being a header cell [assigned][] to the closest [ancestor][] of the link in the [flat tree][] that has a [semantic role][] of `cell` or `gridcell`; or
- being referenced by an `aria-describedby` attribute of the link.

This definition is based on the [WCAG definition of programmatically determined link context](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-programmatically-determined-link-context).

This definition assumes that the HTML document with the link is a document using HTML according to the specification.
