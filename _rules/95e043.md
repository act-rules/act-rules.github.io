## Applicability

This rule applies to any HTML `<audio>` `<video>` or `<source>` `src` file content with a `duration` of more than 3 seconds, that is set to `autoplay` and or `loop`, and has audio output that is not `paused` or `muted`.

## Expectation 1

For each test target a control mechanism is provided to pause or stop the audio, or turn the audio volume off independently from the overall system volume control.

## Expectation 2

The control mechanism to pause or stop or turn the audio volume off is [visible](#visible), has an [accessible name](#accessible-name) and is one of the first five focusable elements in the [document](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-document).

## Test Cases

### Passed

The `audio` element has a control mechanism.

``` html
  <audio src="../test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" autoplay="true" controls></audio>
```

### Passed example 2

The `video` element has a control mechanism.

``` html
 <video autoplay="true" controls>
  <source src="../test-assets/rabbit-video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="../test-assets/rabbit-video/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>
```

### Failed

### Failed example 1

``` html
  <audio src="../test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" autoplay="true"></audio>
```

### Failed example 2

The `video` element autoplays and does not have a control mechanism.

``` html
 <video autoplay="true">
  <source src="../test-assets/rabbit-video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="../test-assets/rabbit-video/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>
```

### Inapplicable

### Inapplicable example 1

The `video` element is `muted`.

``` html
 <video autoplay="true" muted="true">
  <source src="../test-assets/rabbit-video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="../test-assets/rabbit-video/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>
```

### Inapplicable example 2

The `video` element `src` file has no audio output.

``` html
 <video autoplay="true">
  <source src="../test-assets/rabbit-video/video-with-incorrect-voiceover.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="../test-assets/rabbit-video/video-with-incorrect-voiceover.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>
```

### Inapplicable example 3
