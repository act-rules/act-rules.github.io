title: Test Modes
---

Test methods are taken as a concept from the Evaluation And Report Language (EARL). It defines three modes:

- Automatic
- Semiautomatic
- Manual


## Automatic
*As defined in EARL*

Where the test was carried out automatically by the software tool and without any human intervention.


## Semiauto
*As defined in EARL*

Where the test was partially carried out by software tools, but where human input or judgment was still required to decide or help decide the outcome of the test.


## Manual
*As defined in EARL*

When a test involves user input to come to a pass or fail conclusion, the rule is considered to be manual.
