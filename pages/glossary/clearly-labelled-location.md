Secondary information and alternative controls of functionality is often not displayed together with primary information or functionality. For example an option to change a web page to dark mode may be place on an options page, instead of being available in every page and page state of a website. Another example is a maps app, where instead of using GPS, an option is availble in a dropdown menu to set the current location of the device. Such content is (usually) placed in a clearly labelled location.

The location of some content can be said to be "clearly labelled" when it can be found by activating user interface components who's label indicates that the purpose of it may lead to finding the content,
or to some further page or page state from which this action can be repeated until the content is found.

Whether or not the content is "clearly labelled" depends on the starting point of the search. If a page A has a clearly labelled link to some piece of important content, it is clearly labelled. Page B, which can be in the same website may not have such a link, or may have a link with an ambiguous link text, and so the location of the content starting from page B is not clearly labelled.
