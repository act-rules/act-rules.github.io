title: Textual content
key: textual-content

A string of characters is considered textual-content if it contains one or more characters from the [letter or number categories of Unicode]( https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/ch04.pdf#G134153). This definition applies to the string as a whole, regardless of any other characters the string might contain.

**Note:** This definition differs from the [WCAG definition of `text`](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-text), since it also requires that "the sequence is expressing something in human language", which is not evaluated as part of this definition.
