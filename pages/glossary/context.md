title: Context
key: context

The context of some piece of information is any other information that helps a user understand it.

Both the [visual context](#visual-context) and the [programmatically determined context](#programmatically-determined-context) are part of the context.

**Note**: The maximal "distance" (both visual distance on the device, and tree distance within the DOM tree) between some information and its context depends on the precise situation, and on what kind of information is looked at.

**Note**: When used to differentiate between two pieces of information, context should not include anything that is "shared" by these two pieces of information: _e.g._, headings that are above only one of these pieces of information may be used as context, but headings that are above both should not.
