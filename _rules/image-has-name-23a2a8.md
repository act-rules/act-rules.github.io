## Applicability

The rule applies to HTML `img` elements or any HTML element with the [semantic role](#semantic-role) of `img` that is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree).

## Expectation

Each target element has an [accessible name](#accessible-name) that is not only [whitespace](#whitespace), or is marked as [decorative](#decorative).

**NOTE**: An `img` element can be marked as decorative, by using either `role="presentation"`, `role="none"` or an empty alt attribute, `alt=""`.

## Assumptions

_There are currently no assumptions._

## Accessibility Support

There is a known combination of a popular browser and assistive technology that does not by default support `title` as an [accessible name](#accessible-name).

## Background

- [G94: Providing short text alternative for non-text content that serves the same purpose and presents the same information as the non-text content](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/G94)
- [G95: Providing short text alternatives that provide a brief description of the non-text content](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/G95)
- [H37: Using alt attributes on img elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/H37)
- [ARIA6: Using aria-label to provide labels for objects](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/ARIA6)
- [ARIA10: Using aria-labelledby to provide a text alternative for non-text content](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/ARIA10)
- [H67: Using null alt text and no title attribute on img elements for images that AT should ignore](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/H67)
- [F38: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to not marking up decorative images in HTML in a way that allows assistive technology to ignore them](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/F38)
- [F65: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to omitting the alt attribute or text alternative on img elements, area elements, and input elements of type "image"](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/F65)
