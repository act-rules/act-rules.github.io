## Test procedure

### Applicability

The rule applies to any HTML element with the [semantic role][] of `image` that is [exposed to assistive technologies][].

**NOTE**: Any image marked as decorative, by using either `role="presentation"`, `role="none"` or an empty `alt` attribute in combination with either no `title` attribute or an empty `title` attribute, does not have the role of `image` according to [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/)

### Expectation

Each target element has an [accessible name][] that is [non-empty][].

## Assumptions

_There are currently no assumptions_

## Accessibility Support

Certain assistive technologies can be set up to ignore the `title` attribute, which means that to some users the `title` attribute will not act as an accessible name.

## Background
- [G94: Providing short text alternative for non-text content that serves the same purpose and presents the same information as the non-text content](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/G94)
- [G95: Providing short text alternatives that provide a brief description of the non-text content](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/G95)
- [H37: Using alt attributes on img elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/H37)
- [ARIA6: Using aria-label to provide labels for objects](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/ARIA6)
- [ARIA10: Using aria-labelledby to provide a text alternative for non-text content](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/ARIA10)
- [H67: Using null alt text and no title attribute on img elements for images that AT should ignore](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/H67)
- [F38: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to not marking up decorative images in HTML in a way that allows assistive technology to ignore them](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/F38) 
- [F65: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to omitting the alt attribute or text alternative on img elements, area elements, and input elements of type "image"](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/F65)
