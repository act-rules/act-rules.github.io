## Applicability

Any [WAI-ARIA state or property][] that is specified on an HTML or SVG element that is [included in the accessibility tree][].

## Expectation

Each test target is either an [inherited][], [supported][], or [required][] [state][] or [property][] of the [semantic role][] of the element on which the attribute is specified. If the element has no [semantic role][], the attribute must be a [global state or property][global].

**Note:** Assessing the value of the attribute is out of scope for this rule.

## Assumptions

_There are currently no assumptions_

## Accessibility Support

Implementation of [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][] varies from one browser or assistive technology to another. Depending on this, some elements can have a [semantic role][] of `none` and their attributes fail this rule with some technologies but users of other technology would not experience any accessibility issue.

## Background

- [Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.1: Parsing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/parsing.html)
- [Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value.html)
- [WAI-ARIA 1.1, Supported States and Properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#states_and_properties)
- [WAI-ARIA 1.1, Global States and Properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#global_states)
- [ARIA5: Using WAI-ARIA state and property attributes to expose the state of a user interface component](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA5)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

The `aria-pressed` [state][] is [supported][] for the [semantic role][] `button`, which is the [implicit role][] for `button` elements.

```html
<button aria-pressed="false">My button</button>
```

#### Passed Example 2

The `aria-pressed` [state][] is [supported][] for the [semantic role][] `button`, which is the [explicit role][] of this `div` element.

```html
<div role="button" aria-pressed="false">My button</div>
```

#### Passed Example 3

The `aria-busy` [state][] is a [global][] [state][] that is [supported][] by all elements, even without any [semantic role][].

```html
<div aria-busy="true">My busy div</div>
```

#### Passed Example 4

The `aria-label` [state][] is a [global][] [state][] and thus [inherited][] for all [semantic role][].

```html
<div role="button" aria-label="OK">✓</div>
```

#### Passed Example 5

The `aria-checked` [state][] is [required][] for the [semantic role][] `checkbox`.

```html
<div role="checkbox" aria-checked="false">My checkbox</div>
```

#### Passed Example 6

The `aria-controls` [property][] is [required][] for the [semantic role][] `combobox`.

```html
<div role="combobox" aria-controls="id1" aria-expanded="false">My combobox</div>
```

#### Passed Example 7

The `aria-controls` [property][] is [required][] for the [semantic role][] `combobox`. [WAI-ARIA states and properties][wai-aria state or property] with empty value are still applicable to this rule.

```html
<div role="combobox" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls>My combobox</div>
```

#### Passed Example 8

The `aria-controls` [property][] is [required][] for the [semantic role][] `combobox`. [WAI-ARIA states and properties][wai-aria state or property] with empty value (specified as an empty string) are still applicable to this rule.

```html
<div role="combobox" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="">My combobox</div>
```

#### Passed Example 9

The `aria-label` [state][] is [global][] and thus [inherited][] for all [semantic role][], including the ones from the [WAI-ARIA Graphics Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/graphics-aria-1.0). This rule is also applicable to SVG elements.

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="graphics-object" width="100" height="100" aria-label="yellow circle">
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```

#### Passed Example 10

This `button` element has an [explicit role][] of `none`. However, it is [focusable][] (by default). Thus it has a [semantic role][] of `button` due to [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][]. The `aria-pressed` [state][] is [supported][] for the `button` role.

```html
<button role="none" aria-pressed="false">ACT rules are cool!</button>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

The `aria-sort` [property][] is neither [inherited][], [supported][], nor [required][] for the [semantic role][] `button`, which is the [implicit role][] for the `button` element.

```html
<button aria-sort="">Sort by year</button>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

This `div` element has no [WAI-ARIA state or property][].

```html
<div role="region">A region of content</div>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

This `div` element is not [included in the accessibility tree][], hence its [WAI-ARIA state or property][] is not checked.

```html
<div role="button" aria-sort="" style="display:none;"></div>
```
