## Applicability

This rule applies to `iframe` elements that are [included in the accessibility tree][] and for which all of the following are true:
- the `iframe` does not have a negative `tabindex` [attribute value][]; and
- the `iframe` does not have an [explicit semantic role][] of `presentation` or `none`.

## Expectation

Each target element has an [accessible name][] that is not empty (`""`).

## Assumptions

If an `iframe` is not perceived by the user as a single control, it does not qualify as a [user interface component][] under WCAG 2. In such a scenario, failing this rule would not fail [success criterion 4.1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value). Unless the `iframe` is both removed from the accessibility tree and removed from [sequential focus navigation][], they usually are considered to be [user interface components][user interface component].

## Accessibility Support

- Browser and assistive technology support for `iframe` elements is currently **inconsistent**. Some examples of inconsistencies include (but are not limited to):
  - There is a known combination of a popular browser and assistive technology that ignores `aria-label` and only announces `title` attribute as an [accessible name][]
  - Some assistive technologies ignore empty `iframe` elements, regardless of if they are focusable or if they have an accessible name.
  - Some browsers instantly redirect focus from `iframe` elements  to the first focusable element inside that iframe. This redirect makes it appear as though the `iframe` never receives focus. This occurs even if the `iframe` has a non-negative `tabindex` [attribute value][].
  - Not all browsers redirect focus on `iframe` elements. This ensures that the contents of `iframe` elements can be scrolled and accessed by using the keyboard. This must not be circumvented by using a negative tabindex, as this will make the `iframe` completely inaccessible for keyboard navigation.

Due to these inconsistencies, the applicability of this rule is scoped for `iframe` elements for which there is no indication of an attempt to remove them from accessibility consideration.  Whether `iframe` elements that are inapplicable to this rule still require an accessible name varies between browsers.

## Background

**Note:** `frame` element is deprecated, this rule does not consider `frame` or `frameset` elements.

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This `iframe` element gets its [accessible name][] from the `title` attribute.

```html
<iframe title="Grocery List" src="/test-assets/SC4-1-2-frame-doc.html"> </iframe>
```

#### Passed Example 2

This `iframe` element gets its [accessible name][] from the `aria-label` attribute.

```html
<iframe aria-label="Grocery list" src="/test-assets/SC4-1-2-frame-doc.html"> </iframe>
```

#### Passed Example 3

This `iframe` element gets its [accessible name][] from the content of the `div` referenced with the `aria-labelledby` attribute.

```html
<div id="frame-title-helper">Grocery List</div>
<iframe aria-labelledby="frame-title-helper" src="/test-assets/SC4-1-2-frame-doc.html"> </iframe>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

This `iframe` element has an empty (`""`) [accessible name][]. The `name` attribute is not used in computing the [accessible name][] of `iframe` elements.

```html
<iframe name="Grocery List" src="/test-assets/SC4-1-2-frame-doc.html"> </iframe>
```

#### Failed Example 2

This `iframe` element has no attributes that would give it a non-empty (`""`) [accessible name][].

```html
<iframe src="/test-assets/SC4-1-2-frame-doc.html"> </iframe>
```

#### Failed Example 3

This `iframe` element has an empty (`""`) [accessible name][] because the `title` attribute has an empty string as its value.

```html
<iframe title="" src="/test-assets/SC4-1-2-frame-doc.html"> </iframe>
```

#### Failed Example 4

This `iframe` element has an empty (`""`) [accessible name][] because the `title` attribute value is trimmed of [whitespace][] by the [accessible name computation][accessible name and description computation].

```html
<iframe title=" " src="/test-assets/SC4-1-2-frame-doc.html"> </iframe>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

This page has no `iframe` element.

```html
<button>take me somewhere</button>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

This `iframe` is not [included in the accessibility tree][] because of setting a style of `display: none;`.

```html
<iframe style="display:none;" src="/test-assets/SC4-1-2-frame-doc.html"></iframe>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 3

This `iframe` element has a negative `tabindex` [attribute value][].

```html
<iframe tabindex="-1" src="/test-assets/SC4-1-2-frame-doc.html" style="height: 250px"> </iframe>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 4

This `iframe` element has a `role` [attribute value][] of `none`.

```html
<iframe src="/test-assets/SC4-1-2-frame-doc.html" role="none"> </iframe>
```
