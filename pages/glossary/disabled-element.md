An element is _disabled_ when it has been rendered [inoperable][] in one of the following ways:

1. The element matches the [`:disabled` pseudo-class][disabled pseudo-class]. For HTML elements this means that the element is [actually disabled][].

2. The element has a [shadow-including ancestor][] whose `aria-disabled` [attribute value][] is "true".

#### Assumptions

This definition assumes that when the `aria-disabled` attribute is specified on an element, this element has also been disabled for users that do not rely on [assistive technology][]. For example, this can be done by disabling pointer events using the `pointer-events` property and by disabling keyboard interactions using the `tabindex` attribute. If this is not the case, the definition will produce incorrect results.
