## Description

This rule checks if images that are marked as decorative do not require a text alternative. Images that are the only content of an interactive element are not covered by this rule, as they are tested by [SC1-1-1+SC-4-1-2-interactive-images](SC1-1-1+SC-4-1-2-interactive-images.html).

*Editor note*: This rule is designed to replace (parts of) [SC1-1-1-text-alternative](/rules/SC1-1-1-text-alternative.html)

## Assumptions

- The `contenteditable` attribute is not used in such a way that it impacts which element is or is not interactive.
- The rule assumes that the role attribute has a valid value, and that the value is not overwritten.

## Background

- https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/
- https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H67.html

## Test procedure

### Selector

Select any `img` element that has no text as it's accessible name, following the [Text Alternative Computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-aam-1.1/#mapping_additional_nd_te).

**Exclude** the image if it is the only [content](../pages/algorithms/content.html) of an [Interactive element](../pages/algorithms/interactive.html) that gets its [name from contents](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#namefromcontent) (ignoring such elements as `select`, `textarea` and `input`, as well as roles such as `textbox` and `scrollbar`).

Note: The text alternative of an img element is empty if it does not have text in the `alt`, `title` or `aria-label` attribute, and if `aria-labelledby` isn't used. If the role is set to `none` or `presentation` the element is also considered decorative.

### Step 1

Give the user the following question:

| Property             | Value
|----------------------|---------
| Presented item       | Selected element
| Question             | Is this element solely for decorative purposes?
| Help                 | Answer with 'Yes', if it is a decorative element such as a spacer, line or background solely used for layout purposes or an element that doesn't convey new information, useful for understanding the content of the page.
| User profile         | Requires sight
| Context              | yes

if yes, return [step1-pass](#step1-pass)

else, return [step1-fail](#step1-fail)

## Outcome

The resulting assertion is as follows,

| Property | Value
|----------|----------
| type     | Assertion
| test     | {{ page.rule_id }}
| mode     | manual
| subject  | << The tested page >>
| result   | << one of the following >>

### step1-fail

| Property    | Value
|-------------|----------
| type        | TestResult
| outcome     | Failed
| description | The image is marked up as decorative, even though it has an informative function.

### step1-pass

| Property    | Value
|-------------|----------
| type        | TestResult
| outcome     | Passed
| description | The image is correctly marked as decorative.
