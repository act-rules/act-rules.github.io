A _semantic [role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#dfn-role)_ is a semantic association that indicates an object's type. This allows tools to present and support interaction with the object in a manner that is consistent with user expectations about other objects of that type.

Valid semantic roles are defined by standards. For web content and applications these are defined within the various [WAI-ARIA specifications](https://act-rules.github.io/glossary/#wai-aria-specifications).

The semantic role of an element is its [explicit semantic role](#explicit-role) if it has any, otherwise, the [implicit semantic role](#implicit-role) is used.
