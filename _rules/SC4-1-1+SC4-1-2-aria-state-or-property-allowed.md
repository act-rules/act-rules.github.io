## Test procedure

### Applicability

Any [WAI-ARIA state or property](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#state_prop_def) that is specified on an HTML or SVG element.

### Expectation

The attribute is either an [inherited](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#inheritedattributes), [supported](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#supportedState), or [required](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#requiredState) [state](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#dfn-state) or [property](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#dfn-property) of the [semantic role](#semantic-role) of the element on which the attribute is specified. If the element has no semantic role, the attribute must be a [global state or property](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#global_states).

**Note:** Assessing the value of the attribute is out of scope for this rule.
