# This file is essential to disable jekyll static site generation (so that ghpages does not automatically pick up changes into master branch).
# This site is served via gh-pages by dynamic building using a custom deployer - [Auto WCAG Deployer](https://github.com/auto-wcag/auto-wcag-deployer)
# The deployer picks up the changes via a webhook.
