## Applicability

The rule applies to any element which is [marked as decorative][].

## Expectation

Each target element either is not [included in the accessibility tree][] or has a [semantic role][] of `none` or `presentation`.

## Assumptions

_There are currently no assumptions_

## Accessibility Support

Implementation of the [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][] differs slightly from one user agent to the other. Hence, some elements might be exposed by one user agent and not by another, and consequently might create accessibility issues only for some users. Nevertheless, triggering the conflict is a bad practice.

## Background

Elements are normally [marked as decorative][] to convey the intention of the author that they are [pure decoration][decorative] and thus shouldn't be exposed to assistive technologies. On the other hand, elements that are [focusable][] are important to know for anybody and should be exposed to assistive technologies; and elements that are defining any [global ARIA attribute][] indicate an intention to communicate something to the assistive technologies (through the `aria-*` attribute). When an element is both [marked as decorative][] and either [focusable][] or defining a [global ARIA attribute][], a conflict arises between these two intentions. The [conflict is resolved][presentational roles conflict resolution] by exposing the element.

Whenever such a conflict occurs, this indicates at the very least mismatching intentions. Such a conflict should be avoided.

When these conflicts arise on [decorative][] [non-text content][], this is also a failure of [Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content][sc111] because [decorative][] [non-text content][] must be implemented in a way that allows assistive technologies to ignore it. When these conflicts arise on text content, or on content which is not [decorative][], this is not a failure of WCAG. Therefore this rule is not mapping to any specific WCAG Success Criterion, and is not an accessibility requirement for WCAG.

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This `img` element is [marked as decorative][] through its `alt` attribute and is not [included in the accessibility tree][] because of the `aria-hidden` attribute.

```html
<img src="test-assets/shared/w3c-logo.png" alt="" aria-hidden="true" />
```

#### Passed Example 2

This `img` element is [marked as decorative][] through its `alt` attribute and is not [included in the accessibility tree][] because it is `hidden` to everyone.

```html
<img src="test-assets/shared/w3c-logo.png" alt="" hidden />
```

#### Passed Example 3

This `nav` element is [marked as decorative][] through its `role` attribute and has a [semantic role][] of `none`.

```html
<nav role="none">
	<a href="https://act-rules.github.io/" aria-label="ACT rules">ACT rules</a>
</nav>
```

#### Passed Example 4

This `img` element is [marked as decorative][] through its empty `alt` attribute and has [semantic role][] of `none`.

```html
<img src="test-assets/shared/w3c-logo.png" alt="" />
```

#### Passed Example 5

This `img` element is [marked as decorative][] through its `role` attribute and has a [semantic role][] of `none` because own attributes are not required to be exposed and thus do no trigger the [presentational roles conflict resolution][].

```html
<img src="test-assets/shared/w3c-logo.png" role="none" alt="W3C logo" />
```

#### Passed Example 6

This `svg` element is [marked as decorative][] through its `role` attribute and has a [semantic role][] of `none`.

```html
<svg role="none">
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

This `nav` element is [marked as decorative][] through its `role` attribute but has a non-empty `aria-label` attribute causing it to be [included in the accessibility tree][] with its [implicit role][] of `navigation`.

```html
<nav role="none" aria-label="global">
	<a href="https://act-rules.github.io/" aria-label="ACT rules">ACT rules</a>
</nav>
```

#### Failed Example 2

This `img` element is [marked as decorative][] through its empty `alt` attribute but has a non-empty `aria-labelledby` attribute causing it to be [included in the accessibility tree][] with its [implicit role][] of `img`.

```html
<img src="test-assets/shared/w3c-logo.png" alt="" aria-labelledby="label" /> <span hidden id="label">W3C logo</span>
```

#### Failed Example 3

This `svg` element is [marked as decorative][] through its `role` attribute but has a non-empty `aria-label` attribute causing it to be [included in the accessibility tree][] with its [implicit role][] of `graphics-document`.

```html
<svg role="none" aria-label="Yellow circle">
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```
