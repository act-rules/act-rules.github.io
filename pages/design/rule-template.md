title: Auto-WCAG Rule Template
---

The rule template contains a plain language description of the rule, some background information, and a list of all assumptions. The test procedure is defined by the selector, a number of steps and a description of the possible outcomes.

Use the [empty atomic rule template](atomic-template-empty.html) to create new auto-wcag rule. When creating a new rule, first read [rule design](rule-design.html).

## Composite rules

Composite rules are rules that take results from different rules and through some logic come to a single result. For example: SC 1.2.3 allows video to pass with either a transcript, an audio description, or if it is a media alternative. Each of these would be atomic rules, that are used in a composite rule. The composite rule than describes that at least one of these must pass for the composite rule to pass.

For more about composite rules, see the [ACT Rules Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#composed-rules). To create a composite rule, use the [empty composite rule template](./composite-template-empty.html).
