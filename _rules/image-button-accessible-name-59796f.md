## Applicability

The rule applies to any HTML `input` element with a `type` attribute in the `Image Button` state, that is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree).

**Note:** The specification of the [`type`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#states-of-the-type-attribute) attribute describes in detail how to map the value of the attribute to its corresponding state.

## Expectation

Each target element has an [accessible name][] that is not empty (`""`).

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that all image buttons are [user interface components as defined by WCAG 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-interface-components).

## Accessibility Support

There is a known combination of a popular browser and assistive technology that does not by default support `title` as an [accessible name][].

## Background

- [WCAG Technique H36: Using alt attributes on images used as submit buttons](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H36)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

The image button has an [accessible name][] through the `alt` attribute.

```html
<input type="image" src="/test-assets/shared/search-icon.png" alt="Search" />
```

#### Passed Example 2

The image button has an [accessible name][] through the `aria-label` attribute.

```html
<input type="image" src="/test-assets/shared/search-icon.png" aria-label="Search" />
```

#### Passed Example 3

The image button has an [accessible name][] through the `title` attribute.

```html
<input type="image" src="/test-assets/shared/search-icon.png" title="Search" />
```

#### Passed Example 4

The image button has an [accessible name][] through the `aria-labelledby` attribute.

```html
<input type="image" src="/test-assets/shared/search-icon.png" aria-labelledby="id1" />
<div id="id1">Search</div>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

The image button element has an empty [accessible name][]. The `name` attribute can not be used to provide an [accessible name][].

```html
<input type="image" name="search" src="/test-assets/shared/search-icon.png" />
```

#### Failed Example 2

The image button has an empty `alt` attribute, and no other attributes that can give it an [accessible name][].

```html
<input type="image" src="/test-assets/shared/search-icon.png" alt="" />
```

#### Failed Example 3

The image button has an `aria-labelledby` attribute, but the referenced element does not exist. This gives the button an empty [accessible name][].

```html
<input type="image" src="/test-assets/shared/search-icon.png" aria-labelledby="non-existing" />
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

The `button` element is not an image button. [Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content) can not fail text buttons. Only non-text content is applicable.

```html
<button>My button</button>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

The `input` element with type with a `type` attribute in the `Button` state is not an image button. [Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content) can not fail text buttons. Only non-text content is applicable.

```html
<input type="button" value="My button" />
```

#### Inapplicable Example 3

The `button` element is tested separately from the `img` element. [Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value) is applied to the button, whereas the image is tested under [Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content)

```html
<button><img src="/test-assets/shared/search-icon.png" alt="Search" /></button>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 4

The `img` element is not a user interface component, and so is not tested for [Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value).

```html
<img src="/test-assets/shared/w3c-logo.png" alt="W3C logo" />
```

#### Inapplicable Example 5

The image button is ignored by assistive technologies because it is not [included in the accessibility tree][]. These are not required to have an accessible name. If at some future state of the page the element gets [included in the accessibility tree][], an [accessible name][] will be necessary.

```html
<input type="image" src="/test-assets/shared/search-icon.png" style="display: none;" />
```

[accessible name]: #accessible-name 'Definition of accessible name'
[whitespace]: #whitespace 'Definition of whitespace'
