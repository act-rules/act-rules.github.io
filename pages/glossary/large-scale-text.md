Text nodes with a [computed](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-3/#computed-value) [font-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/#propdef-font-size) of:

- at least 18 [points](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#pt), or
- at least 14 [points](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#pt) and a [computed](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-3/#computed-value) [font weight](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/#font-weight-prop) CSS property of 700 or higher.

For CJK (Chinese, Japanese and Korean) languages, [full-width](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/tr11-31.html#Relation) characters with a [computed](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-3/#computed-value) [font-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/#propdef-font-size) of: 
- at least 22 [points](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#pt), or
- at least 18 [points](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#pt) and a [computed](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-3/#computed-value) [font weight](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/#font-weight-prop) CSS property of 700 or higher.

Notes:
The WCAG definition of [large scale text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-large-scale) lacks clarity regarding the equivalent [font-size](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/#propdef-font-size) for CJK languages. According to WCAG:  
"[large scale (text)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-large-scale): with at least 18 point or 14 point bold or font size that would yield equivalent size for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) fonts"  
Additionally, WCAG includes a note that specifies:  
"The 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the minimum size for large print (14pt) and the larger standard font size (18pt). For other fonts such as CJK languages, the "equivalent" sizes would be the minimum large print size used for those languages and the next larger standard large print size."

Since there is no official WCAG definition of "equivalent size" for CJK languages, we rely on the guidelines provided in the [Japanese translation of the WCAG 2.1](https://waic.jp/translations/WCAG21/#dfn-large-scale). This translation offers the following insights:  
"NOTE  
The 18-point and 14-point sizes for half-width alphanumeric text are based on the minimum enlarged print size (14 points) and standard large type size (18 points). For other characters, such as CJK languages, the "equivalent" size is the minimum size for enlargement in that language and the next largest standard size for enlargement."  
and  
"TRANSLATION NOTE  
In the case of Japanese full-width characters, 22 point or 18 point bold type is considered to be the "equivalent" size, based on the First Report of the Enlarged Textbook Promotion Council, "Chapter 2 Standards for Enlarged Textbooks." is reasonable."

It's important to note that in the Japanese translation, the term "roman text" has been replaced with "half-width alphanumeric text," and a new requirement has been explicitly introduced for "Japanese full-width characters." 

Since distinguishing between half-width alphanumeric text and full-width characters is not straightforward, the decision has been made to adopt the Unicode standard for [CJK Unified Ideographs](https://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U4E00.pdf) within the range of 4E00â€“9FFF as the basis for this distinction.
