Algorithm to check validity of textual alternative. It must be [non-empty][NEMPTY], not a filename, an URL or a placeholder.

Check following for the result of the [Text Alternative Computation][TXTALT] algorithm:

## Step 1.	Alternative is non-empty

If the regular-expression `/([a-zA-Z0-9])+/ig` has less than three matches, return invalid.

## Step 2.	Alternative is not a filename

If the regular-expression `/.+\.(bmp|jpg|jpeg|jfif|gif|png|tif|tiff)/` matches, return invalid. (List of formats may be extended).

## Step 3.	Alternative is not a URI

Matching URIs by a regular expression is quite complex, but could be done. On match, return invalid.

## Step 4.	Alternative is not a placeholder

To identify placeholders, a blacklist (possibly of regular expressions) should be maintained to compare the textual alternative. On match, return invalid.

Example: {nbsp, spacer, bullet, image, photo, picture, placeholder, alt, â€¦}

If none of the above issues is found, return valid.

**Note**: For step 2 and 3 it may be simpler to check, if the textual alternative is contained in the value of the `href` or respectively in the value of the `src` attribute, because in most cases these invalid texts are inserted automatically by content management or portal systems.
