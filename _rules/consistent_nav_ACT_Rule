## Applicability

This rule applies to any navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated by the user.

Applies to all technologies. This technique relates to 3.2.3: Consistent Navigation (Failure).


## Expectation 

Navigational mechansisms that are repeated on multiple pages within a set of Web pages occur in the same relaative order each time they are repeated.

## Assumptions

"Same relative order" means that secondary navigation items may be in between the link items on some pages. They can be present without affecting the outcome of this test.

## Accessibility Support

There are no accessibility support issues known.

## Background

- (e.g. WCAG Techniques or links with background information mentioned in Applicability, Expectations or Assumptions)

## Test Cases

Procedure
Check to see if a navigation mechanism is being used on more than one Web page.
Check the default presentation of the navigation mechanism on each page to see if the list of links are in the same relative order on each Web page.
"Same relative order" means that secondary navigation items may be in between the link items on some pages. They can be present without affecting the outcome of this test.

Expected Results
If #1 is true and #2 is false, then this failure condition applies and content fails the Success Criterion.

### Passed


A search field is the last item on every Web page in a site. Users can quickly locate the search function.

An expanding navigation menu

A navigation menu includes a list of seven items with links to the main sections of a site. When a user selects one of these items, a list of sub-navigation items is inserted into the top-level navigation menu.

Consistently positioned skip navigation controls

A "skip navigation" (or "skip to main content") link is included as the first link on every page in a Web site. The link allows users to quickly bypass heading information and navigational content and begin interacting with the main content of a page.

Skip to navigation link

Navigational content is consistently located at the end of each page in a set of Web pages. A "skip to navigation" link is consistently located at the beginning of each page so that keyboard users can easily locate it when needed.

#### Passed Example 1

A consistently located control. Presenting repeated components in the same relative order each time they appear.


Examples of a navigation mechanism that presents links in same order.

#### Passed Example 2

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

##### Description

This describes a failure condition for all techniques involving navigation mechanisms that are repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages (Success Criterion 3.2.3). If the mechanism presents the order of links in a different order on two or more pages, then the failure is triggered.

Example 1: An XHTML menu presenting a series of links that are in a different relative order on two different pages
Examples of a navigation mechanism that presents links in a different order.

### Glossary

assistive technology
hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents

Note
functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible).

Note
Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs.

Note
The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.

Assistive technologies that are important in the context of this document include the following:

screen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing, color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability of rendered text and images;
screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information through synthesized speech or braille;
text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;
speech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some physical disabilities;
alternative keyboards, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single switches, sip/puff and other special input devices.);
alternative pointing devices, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate mouse pointing and button activations.
same relative order
same position relative to other items

Note
Items are considered to be in the same relative order even if other items are inserted or removed from the original order. For example, expanding navigation menus may insert an additional level of detail or a secondary navigation section may be inserted into the reading order.

set of web pages
collection of web pages that share a common purpose and that are created by the same author, group or organization

Examples include a publication which is split across multiple Web pages, where each page contains one chapter or other significant section of the work. The publication is logically a single contiguous unit, and contains navigation features that enable access to the full set of pages.

Note
Different language versions would be considered different sets of Web pages.

user agent
any software that retrieves and presents Web content for users

Web browsers, media players, plug-ins, and other programs — including assistive technologies — that help in retrieving, rendering, and interacting with Web content.

web page
a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent

Note
Although any "other resources" would be rendered together with the primary resource, they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other.

Note
For the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be "non-embedded" within the scope of conformance to be considered a Web page.

A Web resource including all embedded images and media.

A Web mail program built using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). The program lives entirely at http://example.com/mail, but includes an inbox, a contacts area and a calendar. Links or buttons are provided that cause the inbox, contacts, or calendar to display, but do not change the URI of the page as a whole.

A customizable portal site, where users can choose content to display from a set of different content modules.

When you enter "http://shopping.example.com/" in your browser, you enter a movie-like interactive shopping environment where you visually move around in a store dragging products off of the shelves around you and into a visual shopping cart in front of you. Clicking on a product causes it to be demonstrated with a specification sheet floating alongside. This might be a single-page Web site or just one page within a Web site.
