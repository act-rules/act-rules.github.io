An _essential text change_ occurs when the text content of an HTML element is required to convey accurate information to the user. An _essential text change_ may appear in any of the following forms:

1. Providing context - Text is changed to provide users with additional information required to understand the current state of the page. For example, while searching for results, text may change to convey the page is *loading* to provide context to the user.
2. Live updates of important information - The content automatically updates to show the most recent information available from a data source and should not be ignored by the user.
