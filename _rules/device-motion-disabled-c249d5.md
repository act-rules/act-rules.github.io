## Applicability

The rule applies to an [HTML document][] with an associated [Window object][] that has an [event listener list][] with one or more [event listeners][event listener] for [device orientation events][device orientation] or [device motion events][device motion].

## Expectation

For each registered [device orientation event][device orientation] or [device motion event][device motion] in the test target one of the following is true:

- **no changes:** The registered event does not cause [changes to the content][changes in content] of the [web page][] within a 10 minutes time span of the [event firing][event firing]; or
- **disabled:** There is at least one set of [instruments][instrument], where each [instrument][] is in the same [web page][] of the registered event or can be found in a [clearly labeled location][] from that [web page][]. The set of [instruments][instrument] can be used to prevent [changes to the content][changes in content] of the [web page][] resulting from the event within a 10 minutes time span of the [event firing][].

**Note:** The 10 minutes time span is an arbitrary limit which is not included in WCAG. Results that happen after this period will not fail this rule but may nonetheless fail [Success Criterion 2.5.4: Motion Actuation][sc2.5.4]. The accessibility problem tends to be less severe for longer time periods, and without a time limit, testing this rule consistently would be impractical.

## Assumptions

- The motion to operate the device is not used through an [accessibility supported][] interface, which is listed as a valid exception to [Success Criterion 2.5.4: Motion Actuation][sc2.5.4].
- The motion is not [essential][] for the functionality it triggers, which is listed as a valid exception to [Success Criterion 2.5.4: Motion Actuation][sc2.5.4].
- The event listeners listening to device motion events trigger a functionality in the web page. If they do not trigger any such functionality failing this rule might not be a failure of the success criterion.
- If there are ways to disable the device motion based functionality that do not require the user to interact with the web page (e.g. a setting at the operating system level), failing this rule might not be a failure of the success criterion.
- This rule assumes that there are no changes in the content of the [web page][] caused by another [event][]. If this is not the case, changes may be attributed to the wrong [event][] and the rule may fail while [Success Criterion 2.5.4: Motion Actuation][sc2.5.4] is still satisfied.
- This rule assumes that the changes happen within a 1 minute time span after the [event][] [firing][] and therefore the comparison between the page before and after the [event][] [firing][] can be made at any time after that time span elapses. If there are changes after this time span, they may not be detected as [changes in content][] and the rule may pass but [Success Criterion 2.5.4: Motion Actuation][sc2.5.4] is not satisfied. The arbitrary 1 minute time span, selected so that testing this rule would not be impractical, is not included in WCAG.

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

- [Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.4: Motion Actuation][sc2.5.4]
- [G213: Provide conventional controls and an application setting for motion activated input](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G213.html)
- [DeviceOrientation Event Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/orientation-event/)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This [HTML document][] has device orientation events that cause **no changes** to the content of the web page.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Passed Example 1</title>
		<script>
			function activateEvent() {
				let counter = 0
				window.addEventListener('deviceorientation', () => {
					counter++
				})
			}
		</script>
	</head>

	<body onload="activateEvent();">
		<p>ACT-R</p>
		<p>Note: This example may not work across all browsers.</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

This [HTML document][] that can be operated through the device's orientation to increase and decrease the value of a slider has a control to **disable** that functionality.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Passed Example 2</title>
		<script src="/test-assets/7677a9/slider.js"></script>
		<script>
			function activateSlider() {
				window.addEventListener('deviceorientation', handleOrientationCanBeDisabled)
			}
		</script>
	</head>

	<body onload="activateSlider();">
		<h1>Slider Motion Sensor Example</h1>

		<p>
			Open this slider on a device with a motion sensor, such as a smartphone or tablet. Tilt the device to the right
			and left to adjust the slider value. The check box disables the motion sensing adjustment.
		</p>
		<p>Note: This example may not work across all browsers.</p>

		<div>
			<input type="range" min="1" max="100" value="50" id="motionSlider" disabled />
			<p aria-live="polite">Slider Value: <span id="output">50</span></p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<input type="checkbox" id="disableMotion" />
			<label for="disableMotion">Disable Motion Actuation</label>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 3

This [HTML document][] that can be operated by rotating the device to increase and decrease the value of a slider has a control to **disable** that functionality.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Passed Example 3</title>
		<script src="/test-assets/7677a9/slider.js"></script>
		<script>
			function activateSlider() {
				window.addEventListener('devicemotion', handleMotionCanBeDisabled)
			}
		</script>
	</head>

	<body onload="activateSlider();">
		<h1>Slider Motion Sensor Example</h1>

		<p>
			Open this slider on a device with a motion sensor, such as a smart phone or tablet. Rotate the device to adjust
			the slider value. The check box disables the motion sensing adjustment.
		</p>
		<p>Note: This example may not work across all browsers.</p>

		<div>
			<input type="range" min="1" max="100" value="50" id="motionSlider" disabled />
			<p aria-live="polite">Slider Value: <span id="output">50</span></p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<input type="checkbox" id="disableMotion" />
			<label for="disableMotion">Disable Motion Actuation</label>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

This [HTML document][] that can be operated through the device's orientation to increase and decrease the value of a slider but has no way to **disable** this functionality.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Failed Example 1</title>
		<script src="/test-assets/7677a9/slider.js"></script>
		<script>
			function activateSlider() {

			}
		</script>
	</head>

	<body onload="activateSlider();">
		<pre class="output"></pre>

		<h1>Slider Motion Sensor Example</h1>

		<p>
			Open this slider on a device with a motion sensor, such as a smartphone or tablet. Tilt the device to the right
			and left to adjust the slider value.
		</p>
		<p>Note: This example may not work across all browsers.</p>

		<div>
			<input type="range" min="1" max="100" value="50" id="motionSlider" disabled />
			<button id="increaseSlider" type="button">Increase Value</button>
			<p aria-live="polite">Slider Value: <span id="output">50</span></p>
		</div>
