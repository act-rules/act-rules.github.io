			<p>
				The world under heaven, after a long period of division, tends to unite; after a long period of union, tends to
				divide.

		<main aria-label="Translation by Moss Roberts (1976)">
			<p>The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been.</p>

			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
