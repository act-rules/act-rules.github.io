	Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten
	lore. While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my
	chamber door. “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door. Only this and nothing more.”
