## Test Procedure

### Applicability

The rule applies to every [non-streaming](#non-streaming-media-element) `audio` element that is:
- playing; or,
- has a "play button" that is [visibile](#visible) and [included-in-the-accessibility-tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree).

**Note:** A play button is an interactive element that when activated, plays the audio. 

### Expectation

The auditory information of each test target is available through a text transcript. That text transcript is [visibile](#visible) and [included-in-the-accessibility-tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree), either on the page or through a link.

**Note**: A "text transcript" in the context of this rule is defined in WCAG 2 as an [alternative for time based media](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-alternative-for-time-based-media).

## Assumptions

*There are currently no assumptions*

## Accessibility support

There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule.

## Background

- [Understanding SC 1.2.1:Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-av-only-alt.html) 
- [G158:Providing an alternative for time-based media for audio-only content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G158.html)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed example 1

Audio with controls and internal transcript

```html
<audio src="../test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" controls></audio>
<p>The above audio contains the following speech: We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.</p>
```

#### Passed example 2

Audio with controls and external transcript

```html
<audio src="../test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" controls></audio>
<a href="/test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech-transcript.html">Transcript</a>
```

#### Passed example 3

Audio with autoplay and external transcript

```html (no-iframe)
<audio src="../test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" autoplay></audio>
<a href="/test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech-transcript.html">Transcript</a>
```

### Failed

#### Failed example 1

Audio with controls and no transcript

```html
<audio src="../test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" controls></audio>
```

#### Failed example 2

Audio with controls and incorrect internal transcript

```html
<audio src="../test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" controls></audio>
<p>The above audio contains the following speech: We choose to go to the cheese in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.</p>
```

#### Failed example 3

Audio with controls and incorrect external transcript

```html
<audio src="../test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" controls></audio>
<a href="/test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech-incorrect-transcript.html">Transcript</a>
```

#### Failed example 4

Audio with autoplay and incorrect external transcript

```html (no-iframe)
<audio src="../test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" autoplay></audio>
<a href="/test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech-incorrect-transcript.html">Transcript</a>
```

#### Failed example 5

Audio with controls and invisible internal transcript

```html
<audio src="../test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" controls></audio>
<p style="text-indent: -9999px;">The above audio contains the following speech: We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.</p>
```

#### Failed example 6

Audio with controls and internal transcript that is not exposed to the accessibility tree

```html
<audio src="../test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" controls></audio>
<p aria-hidden="true">The above audio contains the following speech: We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.</p>
```
