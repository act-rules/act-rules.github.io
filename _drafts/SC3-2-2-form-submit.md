## Description

This test checks that forms with submit button initiate a change of context only when submit is used. Any other behavior must be explained to the user at the beginning of the form.

## Background

- [F36: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.2 due to automatically submitting a form and presenting new content without prior warning when the last field in the form is given a value](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140916/F36)
- [F37: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.2 due to launching a new window without prior warning when the selection of a radio button, check box or select list is changed](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140916/F37)
- [G13: Describing what will happen before a change to a form control that causes a change of context to occur is made](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140916/G13)

## Test procedure

### Selector

Test mode: [automatic][AUTO]

Select form element with submit button (`input[@type='submit'] or input[@type='image'] or button[@type='submit']`).

For each selected item, go through the following steps:

### Step 1

Test mode: [manual][MANUAL]

**User Input Question:**

| Property             | Value
|----------------------|---------
| Presented item       | selected form including all form controls
| Requires context     | no
| Requires Interaction | yes
| Question             | Fill in the form. Does any of the form controls cause a change of context when its value is changed?
| Help                 | Changing a control means checking a checkbox, entering text into a text field, or changing the selected option in a list control or set of radio buttons. Examples for change of context are: Opening a new window, moving focus to a different component, going to a new page (including anything that would look to a user as if they had moved to a new page) or significantly re-arranging the content of a page are examples of changes of context.
