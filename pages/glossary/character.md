A character is a single [Unicode](http://unicode.org/) [scalar value](http://unicode.org/glossary/#unicode_scalar_value).

In plain language a character is normally understood to be a [grapheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme), that is a single, distinct symbol used in writing. 
However, this does not map well to computers.

A character is not to be confused with a [grapheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme), that is a single, distinct symbol used in writing, or a [glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph), which is a written representation of a grapheme.

A character is a [code point](http://unicode.org/glossary/#code_point), specifically an integer, that a computer uses for representing a value within the Unicode system. 

As such, multiple characters may represent the same glyph and multiple glyphs may represent the same grapheme.
