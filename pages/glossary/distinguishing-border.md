title: Distinguishing Border
key: distinguishing-border

Look at the `width`, `style`, and `color` of the `border-top`, `border-bottom` or `outline`.

For one of these to be a distinguishing border, all the following must be true:

* The *-width is greater than 0
* The *-style is not set to none 
* The *-color is not transparent

If either `border-top`, `border-bottom` or `outline` is distinguishable, the element has a distinguishing border.

### Assumptions
* Use of a `border`, of 1 or more pixels, not set to none, and not with a color of transparent, is assumed to be sufficiently distinguishable.
