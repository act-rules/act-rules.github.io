## Rule

A rule is the description of the procedure used to evaluate the status (pass or fail) of one ore more conditions of a requirement in a given context.

The rule defines:
 - the context in which it is applicable (e.g. a set of elements in a DOM)
 - a set of assumptions about the environment (e.g. the way in which technologies are used)
 - a set of logical steps to carry out the procedure
 - a set of possible results

## Test

A test is the application of a rule.

## Requirement

A requirement is a statement of necessity in a given domain (e.g. accessbility). It can be broken down into a set of conditions.
