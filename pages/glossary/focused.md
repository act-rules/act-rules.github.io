An element is said to be _focused_ when the element matches the [`:focus` pseudo-class](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#focus-pseudo) uninterruptedly for a period of 5 seconds after a user stopped interacting with the page.

The 5 seconds time span is an arbitrary limit which is not included in WCAG. Given the possibility of the focus state of elements being managed through scripts, testing the focused state of an element consistently would be impractical without a time limit.
