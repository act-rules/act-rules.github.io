## Guidance for the PR (pull request) creator

**When creating PR:**
- [ ] Make sure you requesting to **pull a issue/feature/bugfix branch** (right side) to the master branch (left side).

**After creating PR:**
- [ ] Add yourself (and co-authors) as "Assignees" for PR
- [ ] Add label to indicate if it's a `Rule`, `Definition` or `Chore` (more to the administrative side)
- [ ] Add relevant project (e.g. "Q3 2018 Status") to PR
- [ ] OPTIONAL: If you want anyone in particular to review your pull request, assign them as "Reviewers".
- [ ] Close the issue that the PR resolves (and make sure the issue is referenced in the top of this comment)

# How to Review And Approve
- Go to the “Files changed” tab
- Here you will have the option to leave comments on different lines. 
- Once the review is completed, find the “Review changes” button in the top right, select “Approve” (if you are really confident in the rule) or "Request changes" and click “Submit review”.
