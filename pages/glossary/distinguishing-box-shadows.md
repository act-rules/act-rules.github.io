Look at the computed values of the `box-shadow` style property.

Two elements have a distinguishing box-shadow if all of the following are true:

- their values are different; and
- if the difference is just based on the color values, and only one of the elements has the color value specified then it has to be different from `transparent` or the `background-color` of the element.
