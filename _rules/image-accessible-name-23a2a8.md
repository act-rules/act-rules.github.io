## Applicability

The rule applies to HTML `img` elements and HTML elements with the [semantic role][] of `img`, except for elements that are not [included in the accessibility tree][].

## Expectation

Each target element has an [accessible name][] that is not empty (`""`), or has a [semantic role][] of `none` or `presentation`.

**Note:** Testing that the [accessible name][] describes the purpose of the element is not part of this rule and must be tested separately.

## Assumptions

_There are currently no assumptions._

## Accessibility Support

- There is a known combination of a popular browser and assistive technology that does not by default support `title` as an [accessible name][].
- There are several popular browsers that do not treat images with empty `alt` attribute as having a role of `presentation` but instead add the `img` element to the accessibility tree with a [semantic role][] of either `img` or `graphic`.
- Implementation of [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][] varies from one browser or assistive technology to another. Depending on this, some elements can have a [semantic role][] of `img` and fail this rule with some technology but users of other technologies would not experience any accessibility issue.
- Images can have their role set to `presentation` through an empty `alt` attribute. [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][] does not specifies what to do if such an image is [focusable][] (it only specifies what to do in case of explicit `role="none"` or `role="presentation"`). Some browsers expose these images and some don't. Thus, this rule may fail for technologies that expose these without creating an accessibility issue for users of other technologies.

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

The HTML `img` element has an [accessible name][] given by the `alt` attribute.

```html
<img alt="W3C logo" />
```

#### Passed Example 2

The element with a [semantic role][] of `img` has an [accessible name][] given by the `aria-label` attribute.

```html
<div role="img" aria-label="W3C logo"></div>
```

#### Passed Example 3

The element with a [semantic role][] of `img` has an [accessible name][] given by an `aria-labelledby` attribute and an element with matching `id`.

```html
<div style="display: none" id="img-label">W3C logo</div>
<div role="img" aria-labelledby="img-label"></div>
```

#### Passed Example 4

The HTML `img` element has an [accessible name][] given by a `title` attribute, though the `title` attribute is not always accessibility supported.

```html
<img title="W3C logo" />
```

#### Passed Example 5

The HTML `img` element has a [semantic role][] of `presentation` through an empty `alt` attribute.

```html
<img alt="" />
```

#### Passed Example 6

The HTML `img` element has a [semantic role][] of `presentation` through [explicit role][].

```html
<img role="presentation" />
```

#### Passed Example 7

The HTML `img` element has a [semantic role][] of `none` through [explicit role][].

```html
<img role="none" />
```

#### Passed Example 8

The HTML `img` element has an [accessible name][] that is not empty.

```html
<img alt=":-)" />
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

The HTML `img` element with [implicit role][] of `img` has an empty [accessible name][].

```html
<img />
```

#### Failed Example 2

The element with role of `img` has an empty [accessible name][].

```html
<div role="img"></div>
```

#### Failed Example 3

The `img` element inside a `div` positioned off screen has an empty [accessible name][] and an [implicit role][] of `img`.

```html
<div style="margin-left:-9999px;"><img /></div>
```

#### Failed Example 4

The HTML `img` element has an empty [accessible name][].

```html
<img alt=" " />
```

#### Failed Example 5

This `img` element has an [explicit role][] of `none`. However, it is [focusable][] due to the `tabindex` attribute. Thus it has a [semantic role][] of `img` due to [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][]. It does not have an accessible name.

```html
<img role="none" tabindex="0" />
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

The element does not have the [semantic role][] of `img`.

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img" width="100" height="100">
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />
</svg>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

The element has a [semantic role][] of `img`, but is not [included in the accessibility tree][].

```html
<div role="img" aria-hidden="true"></div>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 3

HTML `img` element is not [included in the accessibility tree][].

```html
<img alt="W3C logo" aria-hidden="true" />
```

#### Inapplicable Example 4

The element is not an `img` element.

```html
<div aria-label="W3C logo"></div>
```
