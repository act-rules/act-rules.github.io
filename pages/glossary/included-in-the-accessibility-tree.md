title: Included in the accessibility tree
key: included-in-the-accessibility-tree

Elements included in the accessibility tree of platform specific accessibility APIs. Elements in the accessibility tree are exposed to assistive technologies, allowing users to interact with the elements in a way that meet the requirements of the individual user.

The general rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree are defined in the [core accessibility API mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam/). For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree can be found in the [HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/) and the [SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/).

> **Note:** Users of assistive technologies might still be able to interact with elements that are not included in the accessibility tree. An example of this is a [focusable](#focusable) element with an `aria-hidden` attribute with a value of `true`. Such an element could still be interacted with using sequential keyboard navigation regardless of the assistive technologies used, even though the element would not be included in the accessibility tree.

#### Examples

This `span` element is included in the accessibility tree (by default, elements are included in the accessibility tree).

```html
<span>ACT rules</span>
```

This `span` element is not included in the accessibility tree because it is hidden to everybody by the CSS property.

```html
<span style="display:none">ACT rules</span>
```

This `span` element is not included in the accessibility tree because it is explicitly removed by the `aria-hidden` attribute.

```html
<span aria-hidden="true">ACT rules</span>
```

This `span` element is positioned off screen, hence is not [visible](#visible), but is nonetheless included in the accessibility tree.

```html
<span style="position: absolute; top:-9999em">ACT rules</span>
```

Although the `span` element with an `id` of "label" is not itself included in the accessibility tree, it still provides an [accessible name](#accessible-name) to the other `span`, via the `aria-labelledby` attribute. Thus, it is still indirectly exposed to users of assistive technologies.

```html
<span id="label" style="display:none">ACT rules</span>
<span aria-labelledby="label">Accessibility Conformance Testing rules</span>
```

Although this `input` element is not included in the accessibility tree, it is still [focusable](#focusable), hence users of assistive technologies can still interact with it by sequential keyboard navigation. This may result in confusing situations for such users (and is in direct violation of [the fourth rule of ARIA (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#fourth)).

```html
<input type="text" aria-hidden="true" name="fname" />
```
