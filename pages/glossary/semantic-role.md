A semantic [role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#dfn-role) is a semantic association that indicates an object's type. This allows tools to present and support interaction with the object in a manner that is consistent with user expectations about other objects of that type.

The semantic role of an element is its [explicit semantic role](#explicit-role) if it has any, otherwise, the [implicit semantic role](#implicit-role) is used.
