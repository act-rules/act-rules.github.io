A block of text is a run of phrasing content containing no consecutive line breaks.

Contained within one [block-like]() [ancestor]()
Contains only [phrasing content](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#phrasing-content)
Has descendants that are [visible]() [text nodes](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#text).

If more than one `br` element is used, followed by additional [visible]() [text nodes](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#text) or [phrasing content](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#phrasing-content) with [visible]() [text nodes](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#text), this is considered a new block of text.

**Editorial note:** What if `pre` element is used?
