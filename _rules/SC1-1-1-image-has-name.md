## Test procedure

### Applicability

The rule applies to any HTML element with the [semantic role](#semantic-role) of `image` that is [exposed to assistive technologies](#exposed-to-assistive-technologies).

**NOTE**: Any image marked as decorative, by using either `role="presentation"`, `role="none"` or an empty `alt` attribute, does not have the role of `image` according to [ARIA in HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#img-alt).

### Expectation

Each target element has an [accessible name](#accessible-name) that is [non-empty](#non-empty).

## Accessibility Support

There is a known combinations of a popular browser and assistive technology that does not by default support `title` as an [accessible name](#accessible-name).

Certain assistive technologies can be set up to ignore the `title` attribute, which means that to some users the `title` attribute will not act as an accessible name.

- [H67: Using null alt text and no title attribute on img elements for images that AT should ignore](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/H67)
- [F38: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to not marking up decorative images in HTML in a way that allows assistive technology to ignore them](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/F38) 
- [F65: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to omitting the alt attribute or text alternative on img elements, area elements, and input elements of type "image"](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20161007/F65)
