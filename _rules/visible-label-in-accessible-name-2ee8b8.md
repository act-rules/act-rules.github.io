## Applicability

This rule applies to any element that has:

- a [semantic role][] that is a [widget][widget roles] that [supports name from content][], and
- [visible text content][], and
- an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute.

**Note:** [widget roles][] that [support name from content][supports name from content] are: `button`, `checkbox`, `gridcell`, `link`, `menuitem`, `menuitemcheckbox`, `menuitemradio`, `option`, `radio`, `searchbox`, `switch`, `tab`, `treeitem`.

## Expectation

The complete [visible text content][] of the target element either matches or is contained within its [accessible name][].

**Note:** Leading and trailing [whitespace][] and difference in case sensitivity should be ignored.

## Assumptions

_There are currently no assumptions_

## Accessibility Support

There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule.

## Background

- [Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.3: Label in Name](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/label-in-name.html)
- [G208: Including the text of the visible label as part of the accessible name](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G208)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This link has [visible][] text that, ignoring trailing whitespace, matches the [accessible name][].

```html
<a href="https://act-rules.github.io/" aria-label="ACT rules ">ACT rules</a>
```

#### Passed Example 2

This link has [visible][] text that, ignoring case, matches the [accessible name][].

```html
<a href="https://act-rules.github.io/" aria-label="act rules ">ACT rules</a>
```

#### Passed Example 3

This button has [visible][] text that is included in the [accessible name][].

```html
<button aria-label="Next Page in the list">Next Page</button>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

This link has [visible][] text that is different from the [accessible name][].

```html
<a href="https://act-rules.github.io/" aria-label="WCAG">ACT rules</a>
```

#### Failed Example 2

This button has [visible][] text that is only partially included in the [accessible name][].

```html
<button aria-label="the full">The full label</button>
```

#### Failed Example 3

This link has [visible][] text with mathematical symbols, that does not match the [accessible name][] because the mathematical symbols were written out in the accessible name. This is [explicitly mentioned in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/label-in-name#mathematical-expressions-and-formulae).

```html
<a href="/" aria-label="Proof of two multiplied by two is four">Proof of 2&times;2=4</a>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

This `nav` is not a widget, so the [visible][] text does not need to match the [accessible name][].

```html
<nav aria-label="main nav">W3C navigation</nav>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

This text field does not need to have its [visible][] text match the [accessible name][]. The content of a textfield shows its value instead of its label. The label is usually adjacent to the textfield instead.

```html
<div>E-mail</div>
<input type="email" aria-label="E-mail" value="Contact" />
```

#### Inapplicable Example 3

This `div` element does not have a widget role, so the [visible][] text does not need to match the [accessible name][].

```html
<div role="tooltip" aria-label="OK">Next</div>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 4

This link has no [visible text content][].

```html
<a href="//w3.org" aria-label="W3C homepage">
	<img src="/test-assets/shared/w3c-logo.png" alt="w3c logo" />
</a>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 5

The content of this link is [non-text content][].

```html
<button aria-label="close">X</button>
```
