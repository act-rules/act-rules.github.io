## Applicability

This rule applies to any [image resources][rendered image resources] rendered in a [web page][].

## Expectation

Each test target has no [visible][] [text][human language], except if at least one of the following is true:

- <dfn id="0va7u6:decorative">decorative</dfn>: The image with text is [purely decorative][]; or
- <dfn id="0va7u6:incidental">incidental</dfn>: The text is not a [significant][insignificant] part of the image; or
- <dfn id="0va7u6:essential">essential</dfn>: The presentation of the text is [essential][].

## Assumptions

- There is no mechanism to change the rendered text in the image resource. Otherwise, the rule might fail while [SC 1.4.5 Images of Text][sc1.4.5] might be satisfied.
- The specific presentation of the text rendered in the image resource can be achieved through formatted text. Otherwise, the rule might fail while [SC 1.4.5 Images of Text][sc1.4.5] might be satisfied.
- When used in HTML, the SVG `<text>` element is not considered to be an image of text. This is because like any other element in HTML, SVG `<text>` can be adjusted through custom style sheets. This does not apply for SVG text that is in a separate file, and displayed through, for example, the `img` element.

## Accessibility Support

There are no accessibility support issues known.

## Background

This rule is designed specifically for [SC 1.4.5 Images of Text][sc1.4.5]. There are however only minimal differences between this criterion and [SC 1.4.9 Images of Text (No Exception)][sc1.4.9]. The two differences are that customizable images of text are allowed, and that images of text are allowed when the presentation cannot otherwise be achieved. These scenarios are so rare the rule ignores them as part of the assumptions, and so the [accessibility requirements mapping](#accessibility-requirements-mapping) of these two criteria is the same.

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This image resource referenced by the `img` element does not contain text.

```html
<img src="/test-assets/shared/fireworks.jpg" alt="fireworks going off behind the Eiffel tower at night" />
```

#### Passed Example 2

This image resource referenced by the `input` element does not contain text.

```html
<input type="image" src="/test-assets/shared/file.svg" alt="New file" />
```

#### Passed Example 3

This image resource referenced by the `svg` element does not contain text.

```html
<svg width="2in" height="3in" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
	<image x="20" y="20" width="200px" height="100px" href="/test-assets/shared/fireworks.jpg">
		<title>Fireworks in Paris</title>
	</image>
</svg>
```

#### Passed Example 4

This image resource referenced by the `object` element contains text, but it is not the most [significant](#0va7u6:incidental) content.

```html
<object data="/test-assets/0va7u6/times_square.jpg" title="Picture of Times Square, New York"></object>
```

#### Passed Example 5

This image resource referenced by the `img` element contains text, but its presentation is [essential](#0va7u6:essential) to convey the information.

```html
<p>
	The following image is a close up of the cover of a Classic Comics book titled "Ivanhoe" illustrating a font that
	looks like an old Gothic style font.
</p>
<img
	src="/test-assets/0va7u6/ivanhoe.png"
	alt="The word Ivanhoe written in a style that resembles old medieval letters. The letter I is colored to resemble copper. The remaining letters are black. The background is yellow."
/>
```

#### Passed Example 6

This image resource referenced by the `background-image` property of the `div` element contains a logo with text. Logotypes are considered an [essential](#0va7u6:essential) exception.

```html
<div
	role="img"
	aria-label="W3C logo"
	style="
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-image: url(/test-assets/shared/w3c-logo.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
  "
></div>
```

#### Passed Example 7

This image resource referenced by the `img` element is an image of text (the book covers), but it is just meant to decorate the webpage of a book store, therefore it is [decorative](#0va7u6:decorative).

```html
<img src="/test-assets/0va7u6/books.jpg" alt="" />
<p>Welcome to my book store</p>
```

#### Passed Example 8

These image resources referenced by the `input` elements are images of text (the letter "A"), but they are not expressing anything in a [human language][]. The image is only used to indicate how the font size can be controlled.

```html
<input
	type="image"
	src="/test-assets/0va7u6/smallA.png"
	style="border: 1px solid black;"
	width="50px"
	height="50px"
	alt="Decrease text size"
/>
<input
	type="image"
	src="/test-assets/0va7u6/bigA.png"
	style="border: 1px solid black;"
	width="50px"
	height="50px"
	alt="Increase text size"
/>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

This image resource referenced by the `img` element contains text for which the particular presentation is not [essential](#0va7u6:essential).

```html
<img
	src="/test-assets/0va7u6/textimage.jpg"
	alt="The Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.0 defines a format for writing accessibility test rules."
/>
```

#### Failed Example 2

This image resource referenced by the `input` element in the [Image Button][] contains text for which the particular presentation is not [essential](#0va7u6:essential).

```html
<input type="image" src="/test-assets/0va7u6/button.jpg" alt="Press me" />
```

#### Failed Example 3

This image resource referenced by the `background-image` property of the `div` element contains text for which the particular presentation is not [essential](#0va7u6:essential).

```html
<div style="background-image: url(/test-assets/0va7u6/textimage.jpg); width: 500px; height: 200px;" />
```

#### Failed Example 4

This image resource referenced by the `img` element contains text that provides redundant information, but it still is information, therefore it is not [decorative](#0va7u6:decorative).

```html
<img src="/test-assets/0va7u6/welcome.png" alt="" />
<p>Welcome to our website</p>
```

#### Failed Example 5

This `img` element loads an SVG with text as an image resource. Because the SVG is loaded as an image resource, instead of being embedded in HTML the text cannot be selected or customized.

```html
<img
	alt="WCAG Rocks"
	src="data:image/svg+xml;utf8,
<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' height='20px' width='80px'>
  <text x='0' y='15'>WCAG Rocks</text>
</svg>"
/>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

The resource referenced by the `object` element does not have [visible pixels][visible].

```html
<object date="/test-assets/0va7u6/textimage.jpg" style="display: none"></object>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

This `svg` element does not have `image` element descendants.

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
	<text x="20" y="35">My</text>
	<text x="45" y="35">cat</text>
	<text x="55" y="55">is</text>
	<text x="70" y="55">Grumpy!</text>
</svg>
