A _section of content_ is a distinct part or subdivision of a document.

A section of content may consist of one or more paragraphs and include graphics, tables, lists and sub-sections that together serve a purpose.

A section of the content may be defined in different ways, and combinations of these, such as:

- HTML markup, using WAI-ARIA landmarks or HTML5 sectioning elements.
- A heading that marks the beginning of the section of content.
