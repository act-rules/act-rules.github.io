title: Short text description
---

## Description
This algorithm shall provide decision support to the users evaluating the sufficiency of short text descriptions.

**Note**: The decision, if this is presented to the users is left to the implementer.

## Background
- [Web Accessibility Tutorials - An alt Decision Tree](http://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/)


If the image is **not purely decorative and intended to be perceived by the users**, the following rules should be applied for provision of an sufficient short text alternative:

If the image **contains text** and:

- the text in the image is not present as real text nearby or
- the text is not only shown for visual effects or
- the text in the image is not present otherwise,

the **text must be provided**.


If the image has **any functional role**, e.g. a link or button, the **functionality must be explained**.


If the image **contributes meaning** to the current page or context and it **shows content that is not redundant to real text** nearby

- and it’s a **simple graphic or photograph**, 

a **brief description** of the image **in a way that conveys that meaning** must be provided.

* and it’s a **graph or complex piece of information**, 

the information in the image must be '''described elsewhere on the page''' and a **reference must be provided**.
