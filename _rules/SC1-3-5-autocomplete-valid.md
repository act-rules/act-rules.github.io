## Test Procedure

### Applicability

The rule applies to any HTML `input`, `select` and `textarea` element with a [non-empty](#non-empty) `autocomplete` attribute, except if one of the following is true:

- The element is not [visible on the page](#visible-on-the-page), and not [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree)
- The element is an `input` element with a `type` property of `hidden`, `button`, `submit` or `reset`
- The element has a `disabled` or `aria-disabled="true"` attribute
- The element has `tabindex="-1"` and has a [semantic role](#semantic-role) that is not a [widget](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#widget_roles)

### Expectation 1

The `autocomplete` attribute is a single term, or a space separated list of terms.

### Expectation 2

The autocomplete term(s) follow the [HTML 5.2 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#autofill-detail-tokens), which requires that it/they match the following in the correct order:

1. Has a value that starts with "section-" _(optional)_
2. Has either "shipping" or "billing" _(optional)_
3. Has either "home", "work", "mobile", "fax" or "pager" _(optional, only for "email", "impp", "tel" or "tel-*")_
4. Has a [correct autocomplete field](#correct-autocomplete-field) _(required)_

**Note**: Autocomplete terms are case insensitive. When multiple terms are used, they must be used in the correct order.

### Exepctation 3

The [correct autocomplete field](#correct-autocomplete-field) is an [appropriate field for the form control](#appropriate-field-for-the-form-control).

## Assumptions

For this rule, it is assumed that the `autocomplete` attribute is not used on form fields that do not correspond to a autocomplete field described in the HTML 5.2 specification. If the `autocomplete` field is used to describe "custom" taxonomy, rather than that described in the specification, this rule may produce incorrect results.

## Accessibility support

While `autocomplete` in a promising technique for supporting personalisation in HTML, support for this is fairly limited. 

## Background

The intent of this rule is to ensure that the `autocomplete` attribute can be used to suport personalization. Many users may find it easier to fill out forms if those can be styled or layed out in a way that is familiar to them. Assistive technologies can do this when a form control is marked up in such a way that its purpose can be understood. For instance, assistive technologies could add familiar icons and colors to different fields, making it easier for the user to understand what the form does.
