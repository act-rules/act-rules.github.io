				Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood in the Peach Garden (Translation by Charles Henry Brewitt-Taylor)
			</p>
			<p>
				The world under heaven, after a long period of division, tends to unite; after a long period of union, tends to
				divide.

			<p id="roberts">Three Bold Spirits Plight Mutual Faith in the Peach Garden (Translation by Moss Roberts)</p>
			<p>The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been.</p>
