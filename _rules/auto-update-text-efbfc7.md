name: Text content that changes automatically can be paused, stopped or hidden
rule_type: atomic
description: |
  This rule checks that for any text content that automatically changes in a 10 minute time span, there are instruments to pause, stop, or hide it or to control its changing frequency. The arbitrary 10 minute time span, selected so that testing this rule would not be impractical, is not included in WCAG. Content that changes less frequently may fail success criteria 2.2.2 without failing this rule.

## Applicability

The rule applies to any [HTML element][] that has a [visible][] [text node][] as a [descendant][] in the [flat tree][] if:

- **changed:** the `innerText` property of the [element][html element] changes multiple times within a 10 minute time span where there is no [user interaction][]; and
- **no child changed:** the [element][html element] does not have [children][child] in the [flat tree][] whose `innerText` property also changes; and
- **not alone:** the [element][html element] has an [ancestor][] element in the [flat tree][] with a non-empty `innerText` property whose value is different from the `innerText` of the test target.

## Expectation

For each test target there is at least one set of [instruments][instrument], where each [instrument][] is in the same [web page][] as the test target or can be found in a [clearly labeled location][] from that [web page][], to achieve one of the following objectives:

- pause and resume the change of the [visible text content][]; or
- stop the change of the [visible text content][]; or
- hide the changing [visible text content][]; or
- control the frequency of the changes of the [visible text content][].

**Note:** If there is more than one test target, the same [instrument][] may be used to pause (or stop, or hide or alter the frequency) of several or even all test targets.

## Assumptions

- The auto-updating of the content is not [essential][], which is listed as valid exception to [Success Criterion 2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide][sc 2.2.2]. When the auto-updating of content is [essential][] this rule may produce incorrect results.
- The content being changed automatically is information. If the automatically changing content is not information (for example, an ASCII rendered spinning icon that does not provide information on what time is left for a process to end or how much progress has been made) the rule might fail but the success criterion might still be satisfied.
- Any [content][] changes are enabled by the content of the [HTML document][] the test target belongs to. Changes originating from any other sources (e.g. browser shortcuts, browser extensions, browser settings, user agents, external browser applications) are not considered.
- All user actions are transmitted by the user agent to the [HTML document][]. If there are other event sources that result from a user action this rule might fail but the success criterion might still be satisfied.
- Available mechanisms for controlling the content changes rely on [activation][]. If there are other mechanisms that do not rely on [activation][] then the rule might fail but the success criterion might still be satisfied.
- If there are other ways to control the automatically changing content that do not require the user to interact with the web page, failing this rule might not be a failure of the success criterion.
- This rule does not check that the pausing instrument does not tie up the user focus. If that happens, then this rule might pass but the success criterion would not be satisfied.

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

- [Understanding Success Criterion 2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide][sc 2.2.2]
- [G186: Using a control in the Web page that stops moving, blinking, or auto-updating content][g186]
- [F16: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.2 due to including scrolling content where movement is not essential to the activity without also including a mechanism to pause and restart the content][f16]

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This `span` element contains text content that is automatically **changed** multiple times without user intervention and there is a button available to stop the automatic changes. The rule is not applicable to the second `p` element because it has a **child changed** (the `span` element).

```html
<body onload="startUpdates()">
	<p>
		The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops standards and support materials to help you understand and
		implement accessibility.
	</p>

	<p>Random number: <span id="target">1</span></p>
	<input type="button" onclick="stopUpdates()" value="Stop changes" />

	<script type="text/javascript" src="/test-assets/efbfc7/script.js"></script>
</body>
```

#### Passed Example 2

This `span` element contains text content that is automatically **changed** multiple times without user intervention and there is a button available to pause and resume the automatic changes. The rule is not applicable to the second `p` element because it has a **child changed** (the `span` element).

```html
<body onload="startUpdates()">
	<p>
		The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops standards and support materials to help you understand and
		implement accessibility.
	</p>

	<p>Random number: <span id="target">1</span></p>
	<input type="button" id="control" onclick="toggleUpdates()" value="Pause changes" />

	<script type="text/javascript" src="/test-assets/efbfc7/script.js"></script>
</body>
```

#### Passed Example 3

This `span` element contains text content that is automatically **changed** multiple times without user intervention and there is a button available to hide the automatically updating content. The rule is not applicable to the second `p` element because it has a **child changed** (the `span` element).

```html
<body onload="startUpdates()">
	<p>
		The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops standards and support materials to help you understand and
		implement accessibility.
	</p>

	<p>Random number: <span id="target">1</span></p>
	<input type="button" onclick="hide()" value="Hide changing content" />

	<script type="text/javascript" src="/test-assets/efbfc7/script.js"></script>
</body>
```

#### Passed Example 4

This `span` element contains text content that is automatically **changed** multiple times without user intervention and there is an [instrument][] available to modify the frequency of the changes. The rule is not applicable to the second `p` element because it has a **child changed** (the `span` element).

```html
<body onload="startUpdates()">
	<p>
		The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops standards and support materials to help you understand and
		implement accessibility.
	</p>

	<p>Random number: <span id="target">1</span></p>
	<label for="interval">Content change frequency (seconds):</label>
	<input type="text" id="interval" />
	<input type="button" onclick="changeFrequency(document.getElementById('interval').value)" value="Change frequency" />

	<script type="text/javascript" src="/test-assets/efbfc7/script.js"></script>
</body>
```

#### Passed Example 5

This `span` element contains text content that is automatically **changed** multiple times without user intervention and the location of an [instrument][] to control the changes is clearly available.

```html
<body onload="startUpdates()">
	<p>
		The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops standards and support materials to help you understand and
		implement accessibility.
	</p>

	<p>Random number: <span id="target">1</span></p>
	<p>To control the random number updates activate the "Control changes" button.</p>
	<input type="button" onclick="openModal()" value="Control changes" />

	<div
		style="
      display: none;
      position: fixed;
      top: 2em;
      left: 10em;
      background-color: #505050;
      color: white;
      padding: 1em;
      padding-top: 0em;
    "
		id="overlay"
	>
		<p>Control changes</p>
		<input type="button" id="control" onclick="toggleUpdates()" value="Pause changes" />
		<input type="button" onclick="hide()" value="Hide changes" />
		<button onclick="closeModal();">Dismiss</button>
	</div>

	<script type="text/javascript">
		function openModal() {
			document.getElementById('overlay').style.display = 'block'
		}
		function closeModal() {
			document.getElementById('overlay').style.display = 'none'
		}
	</script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="/test-assets/efbfc7/script.js"></script>
</body>
```
