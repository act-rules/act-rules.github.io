title: Accessible Name
key: accessible-name
---

The programatically determined name of a user interface element that is exposed to assistive technologies.

The accessible name is calculated using the [accessible name computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname).

For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional information on how to calculate the accessible name can be found in [W3C
HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0, Accessible Name and Description Computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/#accessible-name-and-description-computation] and [W3C
SVG Accessibility API Mappings, Name and Description](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/#mapping_additional).

If deciding whether an accessible name should be considered the same as e.g. another accessible name or a visible name, leading and trailing whitespace and differences in case sensitivity should be ignored.
