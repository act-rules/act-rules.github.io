# Auto-WCAG Rules repository

The Auto-WCAG Rules repository is where the Auto-WCAG community group maintains the rules they designed for (semi)automated accessibility testing. Within the rules directory you will find all the rules recommended by the Auto-WCAG community group for implementation in automated test tools.

Visit the [Auto-WCAG Rules website](https://auto-wcag.github.io/auto-wcag/) for the latest rules and drafts.
