A block of text is a run of phrasing content containing no consecutive line breaks.

Contained within one [block-like]() [ancestor]()
has [rendered text]() or [phrasing content](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#phrasing-content) with rendered text

If more than one `br` element is used, followed by additional [rendered text]() or [phrasing content](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#phrasing-content) with rendered text, this is considered a new block of text.
