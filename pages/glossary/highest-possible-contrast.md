The highest value of the [contrast ratios](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-contrast-ratio) between two sets of colors (A and B).
To calculate the highest value, find the colors in each set with the largest and smallest 
[relative luminance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-relative-luminance) (A-lum-max, A-lum-min, B-lum-max, B-lum-min). The
highest possible contrast is then the larger of the [contrast ratios](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-contrast-ratio)
of A-lum-max with B-lum-min versus A-lum-min with B-lum-max.
