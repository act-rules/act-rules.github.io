title: Distinguishing style
key: distinguishing-style
--

Compare the style properties `font-family`, `font-weight`, `font-style`, `text-decoration` of the element to that of the surrounding text.

If any of the properties have a different value for the one than for the other, the style is distinguishable.

### Assumptions
- This definition assumes that one of the following shorthand CSS properties (or the related expanded properties e.g. `font-family`) is used to make the element visually evident: `font` or `text-decoration`
- This definition assumes that any change in font is sufficiently distinguishable, and that fonts are loaded when they are present
