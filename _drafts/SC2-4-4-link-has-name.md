## Test procedure

### Applicability

The rule applies to any HTML or SVG element with the semantic role of `link` that are [visible on the page][] or [exposed to assistive technologies][].

**Note**: Roles can be [implicit](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#dfn-implicit-aria-semantics) through the element name or explicit through the [role attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/dom.html#aria-role-attribute).

### Expectation

Each target element has an [accessible name][] that is [non-empty][].

## Assumptions

- The rule assumes that all links are user interface components as defined by WCAG 2. When the link role is used incorrectly, this assumption may not be true.

## Accessibility Support

There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule.

## Background

- Links to Techniques for WCAG 2.0
- Latest version: Techniques for WCAG 2.0 W3C Working Group Note 8 April 2014
- Link to other methodologies, test specifications or tools
- Links to test cases, test suites, unit tests, etc.
- The WCAG 2.0 Techniques already contain examples and code snippets to illustrate which content passes or fails the test. Whenever possible auto-wcag refers to those. Another source for test cases is the W3C Before and After Demonstration.
