An element _can be targeted by pointer events_ when both the following conditions are true:

- the element is [focusable][]; and
- the element is [visible][]. <- not covered, even by transparent stuffâ€¦

[focusable]: #focusable 'Definition of Focusable'
[visible]: #visible ' Definition of Visible'
