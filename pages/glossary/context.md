title: Context
key: context

The context of some piece of information is any other information that helps a user understand it.

Both the [visual context](#visual-context) and the [programatically determined context](#programatically-determined-context) are part of the context.

**Note**: The maximal "distance" between some information and its context depends on the precise situation, and on what kind of information is looked at. Notably, context used to differentiate between two pieces of information should not include anything that is "shared" by these two pieces of information: headings that are ancestors of only one of these pieces of information may be used as context, but headings that are ancestor to both may not.
