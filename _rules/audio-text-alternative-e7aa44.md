## Applicability

The rule applies to any [non-streaming](#non-streaming-media-element) `audio` element that is:

- playing; or,
- has a "play button" that is [visible][] and [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree).

**Note:** A play button is an interactive element that when activated, plays the audio.

## Expectation

For each test target, the [outcome](#outcome) of at least one of the following rules is passed:

- [`Audio` Element Content Has Transcript](https://act-rules.github.io/rules/2eb176)
- [`Audio` Element Content Is Media Alternative For Text](https://act-rules.github.io/rules/afb423)

## Assumptions

This rule assumes that the language of each test target can be correctly determined (either programmatically or by analyzing the content), and sufficiently understood.

## Accessibility Support

There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule.

## Background

- [Understanding SC 1.2.1:Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded)
- [G158: Providing an alternative for time-based media for audio-only content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G158)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

Audio with controls and internal transcript

```html
<html lang="en">
	<audio src="/test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" controls></audio>
	<p>
		The above audio contains the following speech: We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things,
		not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best
		of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
		postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
	</p>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

An audio element that describes some of the text on the same page. The text on the page labels the audio as an alternative.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<p>
		A part of a speech by John F. Kennedy: We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not
		because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of
		our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
		postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also listen to the audio file below to hear the above part of the speech.
	</p>
	<audio src="/test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" controls></audio>
</html>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

Audio with controls and incorrect internal transcript

```html
<html lang="en">
	<audio src="/test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" controls></audio>
	<p>
		The above audio contains the following speech: We choose to go to the cheese in this decade and do the other things,
		not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best
		of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
		postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
	</p>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 2

An audio element that describes some of the text on the same page. The text is not [visible][] on the page.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<p style="display: none;">
		A part of a speech by John F. Kennedy: We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not
		because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of
		our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
		postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also listen to the audio file below to hear the above part of the speech.
	</p>
	<audio src="/test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" controls></audio>
</html>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

Audio without controls.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<audio src="/test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3"></audio>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

An audio element that describes some of the text on the same page. The text on the page labels the audio as an alternative but the controls are not [visible][] on the page.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<p>
		A part of a speech by John F. Kennedy: We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not
		because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of
		our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
		postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also listen to the audio file below to hear the above part of the speech.
	</p>
	<audio src="/test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" controls style="display: none;"></audio>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 3

This `a` element links to an audio file, but there is no `audio` element on this page.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<p>
		A part of a speech by John F. Kennedy: We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not
		because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of
		our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
		postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
