title: Accessible Name
---

The accessible name is the name of a user interface element. Each platform accessibility API provides the accessible name property. 

The value of the accessible name may be derived from a visible (e.g., the visible text on a button) or invisible (e.g., the text alternative that describes an icon) property of the user interface element.
