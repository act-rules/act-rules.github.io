## Assumptions

Tables that have no tabular mark-up are interpreted by assistive technologies as layout tables. According to WCAG this includes:

- No header cells: that is `th` elements, or `td` with ARIA roles rowheader and columnheader.
- No `caption` element.
- No (or empty) `summary` attribute.
- No `scope` or `headers` attributes on table cells.
- Tables with single column or row, or tables with less than two rows containing two valid data cells are automatically marked as layout tables by assistive technologies. A cell is considered valid
  - if its size can be obtained and is between 200 and 16000 pixels, or
  - if its size can't be obtained and it contains text (Cells only containing graphics are not considered valid).

## Test procedure
Â 
### Selector

Test mode: [automatic][AUTO]

Select all tables on the page marked as presentational (using role="presentation" on the table element.

In addition, select tables with all of the following characteristics (see conditions for layout tables listed above):

- Tables with no designated header cells (`th` elements or `td>` elements with ARIA roles rowheader and columnheader.
- No `caption` tag
- No (or empty) summary attribute

For each selected item, go through the following steps:

### Step 1 - Check if actual data tables have wrongly been marked as presentational using ARIA

Test mode: [automatic][AUTO]

for each table with role="presentation".

Check if table contains

- header cells
- a caption element or or summary attribute
- a cell with a scope or headers attribute

If yes,

| Outcome  | Failed
|----------|-----
| Testcase | SC1-3-1-tables-layout
| ID       | SC1-3-1-tables-layout-fail1
| Error    |  A datatable is marked as presentational for assistive technologies.

else, continue with [Step 2](#step-2)

### step 2

Test mode: [automatic][AUTO]

Check if any `td` element has a `headers` attribute or a `scope` attribute.

If yes,

| Outcome  | Failed
|----------|-----
| Testcase | SC1-3-1-tables-layout
| ID       | SC1-3-1-tables-layout-fail2
| Error    | Layout tables cannot associate a cell with other cels.

else, continue with [Step 3](#step-3)

### step 3

Test mode: [manual][MANUAL]

For each remaining table that matches the selector, ask user to confirm that the table is not a data table.

**User Input Question:**

| Property             | Value
|----------------------|---------
| Presented item       | A table (or page with location of table highlighted)
| Question             | Does the table look like an actual datatable?
| Help                 | A datatable is a table that: Visually looks like a table and, b. When you look at a cell in the table, you need to check its column header or row header to fully understand the content of that cell.
| Requires context     | no
| Requires Interaction | no

if yes

| Outcome  | Failed
|----------|-----
| Testcase | SC1-3-1-tables-layout
| ID       | SC1-3-1-tables-layout-fail3
| Error    | Table containing tabular data is presented as a layout table.
