## Applicability

This rule applies to any [semantic link][] for which all the following is true:

- the link is [included in the accessibility tree][]; and
- the link has a non-empty (`""`) [accessible name][].

## Expectation

Each test target has an [accessible name][] which describes its purpose.

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that the purpose of the link is not ambiguous to users in general when seen in context on the web page, which is the exception mentioned in [Success Criterion 2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only)][sc249]. If the link is ambiguous to users in general, users of assistive technologies are not at a disadvantage when viewing the link out of context.
- This rule assumes that all elements with the [semantic role][] of ['link'][link] are used as links. An element marked up as a link, but that does not behave as a link would not fail [Success Criterion 2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only)][sc249].
- This rule assumes that the language of each test target can be correctly determined (either programmatically or by analyzing the content), and sufficiently understood.

## Accessibility Support

- Implementation of [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][] varies from one browser or assistive technology to another. Depending on this, some elements can have a [semantic role][] of `link` and fail this rule with some technology but users of other technologies would not experience any accessibility issue.

## Background

- [Link has non-empty accessible name](https://act-rules.github.io/rules/c487ae)
- [Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.9: Link Purpose (Link Only)][usc249]
- [G91: Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G91)
- [H30: Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link for anchor elements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H30)
- [H24: Providing text alternatives for the area elements of image maps](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H24)
- [ARIA7: Using aria-labelledby for link purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA7)
- [ARIA8: Using aria-label for link purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA8)
