The programatically determined context of some piece of information (*e.g* an element) is all the additional information that has a [programmatically determinable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-programmatically-determinable) connection to it.

It includes, but is not restricted to, `aria-label` attribute, element that are refered by `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` attribute, ancestor `label` elements, `label` elements referring the current element with a `for` attribute, â€¦
