## Test procedure

### Applicability

The rule applies to any `SVG` element that is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree).

### Expectation

Each target element has a [non-empty](#non-empty) accessible name.

## Assumptions

*There are currently no assumptions*

## Accessibility support

Browser and assitive technology support for SVG `title` and `desc` elements is currently inconsistent. Using WAI ARIA in combination with the `img` role for non-decorative `svg` elements significantly.

## Background

- [Understanding Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content.html)
- [F30: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 and 1.2.1 due to using text alternatives that are not alternatives (e.g., filenames or placeholder text)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/failures/F30)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Pass example 1

The populated `svg` `text` element contains text content which serves as the accessible name

```html
<svg width="100" height="100">
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow"></circle>
  	<text font-size="36" fill="black" font-family="Verdana" text-anchor="middle" alignment-baseline="middle" x="22" y="34.4">A yellow circle</text>
</svg>

```

#### Pass example 2

The poulated `svg` `title` element includes the `svg` in the accessibility tree and serves as the accessible name.

```html
<svg width="100" height="100">
  <title>A yellow circle</title>
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```

#### Pass example 3

The `svg` element's populated `aria-label` includes the `svg` in the accessibility tree and serves as the accessible name.

```html
<svg width="100" height="100" aria-label="A yellow circle">
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```

### Failed

#### Failed example 1

The `svg` `text` element is included in the accessibility tree but has no text content or accessible name.

```html
<svg width="100" height="100">
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow"></circle>
  	<text font-size="36" fill="black" font-family="Verdana" text-anchor="middle" alignment-baseline="middle" x="22" y="34.4"></text>
</svg>
```

#### Failed example 2

The `svg` element is included in the accessibility tree using `img` role but the element does not have an accessible name.

```html
<svg width="100" height="100" role="img">
  <circle role="none" cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```

#### Failed example 3

The `svg` element is included in the accessibility tree using a valid `tabindex` integer but does not have an accessible name.

```html
<svg tabindex="0" width="100" height="100" >
<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable example 1

The `svg` element is not included in the accessibility tree 

```html
<svg width="100" height="100">
<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```

#### Inapplicable example 2

The `svg` element has an accessible name using the `title` element but is excluded from the accessibility tree using the `aria-hidden` attribute.

```html
<svg aria-hidden="true" width="100" height="100">
  <title>A yellow circle</title>
  <circle role="none" cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```

#### Inapplicable example 3

The `svg` element is not included in the accessibility tree because the `title` element is empty.

```html
<svg width="100" height="100" role="img">
  <title> </title>
  <circle role="none" cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="yellow"></circle>
</svg>
```
